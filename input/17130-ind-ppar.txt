                                         I. HIGHLIGHTS

1.          Objectives and Scope. The Project was the first Bank loan to the Industrial Credit
and Investment Corporation of India Umited (ICICI). The objective of the Loan was to provide
foreign exchange resources to support ICICI's lending program mainly for modernization and
expansion of the existing production facilities of private medium-sized enterprises and partly for
new industrial projects designed to introduce new technology in India.

2.           Cost. Financin g and Schedule. Out of the total loan amount of $100.0 million
provided from ordinary capital resources, $98.79 million were utilized (net of cancellations) to
assist 86 subprojects. The remainder was cancelled. The loan closing was delayed by one
year due to delays in implementation of the subprojects caused by several factors such as
change in scope of the project, devaluation, delay in procurement and an increase in import
duties as the sponsor's costs were increased and additional funding was needed.

3.           Implementation. About 90 per cent of the funds went to subprojects in the
manufacturing sector with the Chemical Subsector using 39 per cent, Machinery and Equipment
11 per cent and Basic Metal products about 10 per cent. The performance of the subprojects
has been satisfactory with only 12 per cent of those financed having present arrears problems;
such projects represent a little more than 1 .8 per cent of the total amount of subloans approved.
The subprojects were generally well run and had a diversity of products. The equipment
provided positive benefits and also provided for job creation, value added and foreign exchange
savings/earnings.

4.           Institutional Aspects. The financial position of lClCl is satisfactory with adequate
reserves and a stable arrears situation. The portfolio is sound and there is general compliance
with covenants. Its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is a capable commercial and
development banker who is supported by qualified and well-trained staff. The lClCl's low
turnover (1 .1 per cent in 1992/93) contributed to a well-organized and competent staff with high
qualifications and the needed expertise.

5.          Environmental Impact. ICICI and the Bank require that sub-borrowers comply with
all environmental rules and regulations of India. Companies visited by the PEM were well
informed about environmental rules for their plants. They applied the rules by recycling water,
dust control and outside air quality monitoring that was checked as often as monthly by
environmental officials.

6.          Cost/Benefit Assessment. For the 71 companies (83 per cent of the projects) with
data for 1992 available, the total value added was about $1,685 million.

7.            Overall Performance and Sustainability. The Project satisfactorily met the primary
purpose of the Loan which was to augment lClCl's foreign exchange resources and to enhance
its financing of development projects by private sector enterprises. ICICI is financially viable and
self sustaining. It has a satisfactory portfolio, good collection and follow-up procedures and
should have no problem in sustaining its operations. The Project is rated as generally
successful.

8.            Feedback. The Project illustrated the need for (a) the development financing
institution (DFI) to make more realistic estimates of implementation schedules when appraising
                                                2

projects; and (b) the DFI to be careful about problem loans, making sure that correct follow-up
is made in a timely manner and at the appropriate level in the organization.


                                       II. BACKGROUND

A.    Rationale

9. Although India has a large skilled work force and a very diversified industrial base,
since the mid 1960 its annual growth in industrial sector production has remained relatively low,
at or about 5 per cent. This was due mainly to an industrial policy framework characterized by
tight Government control and protection. This caused industry to pay insufficient attention to
economies of scale and product quality resulting in a high cost structure, low technical
standards and poor quality. During the 1980s the industrial sector in India was in need of
modernization of production facilities, upgrading of technology and expansion of plants. These
areas were assigned high priority under the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan (FY 1985/86-
FY 1989/90). The primary purpose of the Bank loan was to augment ICICI's foreign exchange
resources and thereby enhance its financing of industrial development projects in the private
sector.

B.    Formulation

10.         The Loan was appraised on the basis of the Bank's own fact-finding and ICICI's
perceived requirements.

C.    Objectives and Sco pe at Appraisal

11. The objective of the Loan was to provide ICICI with foreign exchange resources in
the form of a credit line and to enable it to expand its role in promoting industrial development.
The industrial sector in India urgently needed to modernize its production facilities, upgrade
technology and product quality, redress imbalances in industrial infrastructure and ancillary
industries, and expand plants to economic size. Modernization and improvement in productivity
have been assigned high priority. Significant scope exists to utilize financial resources to
modernize production facilities with a view to attaining overall international competitiveness in
terms of cost and quality, The Bank loan was utilized primarily for the modernization of existing
production facilities to increase productivity of industry. However, a portion of the Loan was
made available for new projects designed primarily to introduce new technology. This new
technology could improve product quality and marketability and reduce price to make products
more competitive.

D.    Financjnq Arrangements

12. The Bank approved a Loan (No. 778-IND) of $100 million on 3 April 1986 for ICICI.
The Loan, from the ordinary capital resources of the Bank, was guaranteed by the Government
of India with the sub-borrowers bearing the foreign exchange risks. The principal of the Loan
is to be repaid within a 1 5-year period.
                                                 3
 E.   Completion

13. The Loan was relent to 86 qualified sub-borrowers for an amount of $98,787,581.00.
To allow ICIQI to fully utilize the Loan, the Bank extended the closing date from 31 July 1990
to 31 July 1991 ..' The Project Completion Report (PCR), prepared by the Bank's Private Sector
Department, was circulated to the Board on 5 January 1993.

 F.   Ex-Post Evaluation

14.          This Project Performance Audif Report (PPAR) focuses on pertinent aspects of the
Loan ex-post, and includes the findings of a Post-Evaluation Mission (PEM) which visited India
during June-July 1993. This PPAR is based on a review of the PCR, the Appraisal Report, Bank
files, discussions with staff members of the Bank and ICICI. Copies of the draft PPAR were
provided to the Government, ICICI, and concerned Bank staff for review and comments.
Comments received were taken into consideration in finalizing the report.


                            Ill. IMPLEMENTATION PERFORMANCE

A. Design

15.          The Loan was approved to augment the foreign exchange resources of ICICI and
was to be utilized primarily for modernization and expansion of existing production facilities and
new projects that would facilitate technology transfer, It was targeted at medium-sized
industrial projects. The design of the Project was well suited to meet the financing needs of the
DFI.

16.          No policy dialogue was undertaken during the processing of the Loan. In 1988, a
financial sector study was undertaken and formal policy dialogue was initiated by the Bank
during a Mission in April 1989. The Appraisal Mission for the second Bank loan continued the
policy dialogue with the Government and concerned financial and capital market institutions.
The dialogue concentrated on issues closely related to such DFI operations as rationalizing
short and long-term interest rates, privatization of ICICI, phasing out of the convertibility clause
on local currency loans,' decontrolling pricing of company new issues, the desirability of
allowing more external mutual funds and more direct foreign investment in India, private sector
participation in the Mutual Fund Industry and the removal of the stipulation setting the maximum
shareholding level by private promoters to 20 per cent in Venture Capital Companies.

17.          The policy dialogue is going in the right direction. Some of the issues covered,
such as, bringing DFI interest rates in line with commercial banks, and those relating to tts
development of capital markets are relevant for the satisfactory performance and financial
viability of DFls. While the Project did not address these issues, their early resolution would be
necessary for sustainable satisfactory performance of ICICI.

      The extension was caused by delays in implementing some subprojects.
 '    Up to 20 per cent of the loan may be converted to equity at lenders option. (This was
      phased out in 1991).
                                               4
B.    Loan Utilization

18. The Loan was used to finance 86 subprojects, of which 12 were above the free limit
(AFL), accounting for $39.3 million or 39.8 per cent of the total loan amount, and 16 were new
subprojects, accounting for $18.4 million or 18.6 per cent. The regional distribution was
generally even, although about 58 per cent of the Loan were concentrated in the Western
Region and none at all in the Northeastern Region.

C.    Subproject Implementation

 19.         Total disbursement under the Loan was $98.8 million. Of the 12 above-free-limit
 (AFL) subprojects, four experienced 2 to 21 months delay, one subproject was completed 2
months ahead of schedule, an automotive subproject was abandoned due to liquidity and
marketing problems and one subproject is still not complete. A petrochemical products
subproject was merged with a mother company delaying the completion by seven months. Of
the 74 below-free-limit (BFL) subloans, 47 incurred time overrun ranging from 1 to as much as
38 months. Cost overruns of Rs 7 million to Rs 9,400 million were incurred by 7 of the 12 AFL
subprojects, while cost underruns of Rs 2 million to Rs 2,567 million were experienced by three
subprojects in the same category. A total of 37 subprojects incurred cost overruns of Rs 1
million up to Rs 2,700 million in the BFL category. Cost underruns of As 1 million to Rs 14
million were experienced by 13 subprojects in the same category. Five subprojects are not yet
complete; a steel forge firm has already incurred 14 months delay while another, a
petrochemical project, is expected to be finished soon. The completion schedule of the other
three subprojects was uncertain at the time of post-evaluation (see Appendix 1 for details).

20.          Almost all the subprojects which experienced time overruns also suffered cost
overruns indicating that one of the major causes of cost overruns was the delay in implementing
the subprojects. Other reasons for cost overrun are the increase in customs duties on imported
equipment and machineries, delay in securing local funding for portions of the required
capitalization and the progressive depreciation of the Indian Rupee in relation to foreign
exchange. Average contribution of the sponsors was about 20 per cent of the total required
investment in the case of AFL subloans and 41 per cent for BFL loans, or an overall average of
28 per cent. The proportion of the sponsors' contribution in the case of AFL loans of 20 per
cent was on the low side with the risk shifted to ICICI and other long-term creditors.

D.    Monitoring and Supervision

21. The Bank despatched three Review Missions to lCICl from June 1987 through
September 1990. Data in the Bank files suggest that the main emphasis of the Review Missions
was on assessing the continued performance of ICICI and the subloans under the Loan. The
Missions required detailed information on the overall health of ICICI and any problems being
encountered. The Missions left review reports with ICICI identifying problems encountered in
implementation and supervision and suggesting solutions to those problems for the ICIC!
management's attention. Monitoring and supervision of this Loan were satisfactory.

E.    Com p liance With Loan Covenants

22. ICICI has complied with the covenants except for the debt-service coverage ratios
which were slightly below the covenanted limit of 1.1 times during 1987/88 and 1988/89,
because of the voluntary repayment of an International Bank for Reconstruction and

   Development (IBRD) loan due to a weaker need for foreign currency loans and a depreciating
   value of the rupee.


                                              IV. PROJECT RESULTS

   A.     Operational Performance of ICICI

   23. The Loan became effective in July 1986 and was closed in July 1991, after a one
   year extension. ICICI's summary of operations under the Loan is shown in Table 1. Details are
   in Appendix 2.

    / Projected at the time of Bank appraisal of the Loan.


   24.          According to lClCl's operational projections, its foreign currency lending to the
   industrial sector for the period 1986-88 was estimated at about $640 million, on a commitment
   basis. Given uncommitted balances of existing credit lines as of 31 December 1985 aggregating
   to $77 million, and an approved IBRD loan of $160 million, a foreign exchange resource gap of
   $403 million remained. Since ICICI intended to utilize the Bank loan of $100 million to meet
   about one fourth of this gap, the Bank loan was timely. The remainder of the foreign exchange
   resource gap ($303 million) would have to be borrowed from other foreign sources.

   25.          lClCI's overall long-term loan approvals continued to increase into 1992/93 at an
   average growth rate of 31.9 per cent. This was far in excess of the projected 20 per cent at the
   time of appraisal arid represents a solid institutional achievement. ICICI's disbursements
   showed similar trends through 1992/93 with an average growth rate of 28.9 per cent compared
   with a projected 21.1 per cent at the time of appraisal.

   B.     Institutional Performance of ICICI

   26.          ICICI's institutional strength continues to be of a high quality, It had a substantial
   increase in professional staff (from 413 in 1988 to 566 in 1993) and a reduction of staff turnover
   from 4.1 per cent in 1988 to 1.1 per cent in 1993. This is attributed to good working conditions,
   job satisfaction and good promotion prospects, together with an adequate package of salary
                                                 6

and fringe benefits. The training of staff continues at a high rate with nomination for training
increasing from 87 staff in 1988-89 to 166 in 1992-93. The training covers a range of expertise
from computers to engineering, appraisal and loan follow-up. The professional attitude and
competence of ICICI's staff are impressive.

27.          At present ICICI has a full-time Chairman, Managing Director, and Executive
Director. The CEO is the Chairman who has had many years of commercial and development
banking experience. The performance of ICICI's management and staff is satisfactory as can
be seen in the Corporation's consistent financial performance, its approval and disbursement
patterns, the strength of its portfolio, and its reputation in the market. Although ICICI is 57 per
cent owned by public sector companies in India, it operates like a fully private sector
organization.

28.          ICICI was devolved in mid-i 990 into a more decentralized operation with zonal
offices in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras (see Appendix 3). These offices now act as the
center for ICICI's business activities. By the end of 1993, together with two more in Bangalore
and Baroda, these offices are expected to operate as profit centers. A new computer system
is now being tested to provide the centers with fully computerized services and the headquarters
in Bombay with complete management information system. With its newly decentralized
operation and strong professional staff, ICICI should be ready to meet the increasing challenges
in banking.

29.           ICICI has disciplined procedures and maintains close contacts with the business
groups and communities in which it operates. Its appraisal techniques, which are modern and
efficient, enable it to examine the management, financial, technical, marketing and economic
aspects of possible projects effectively. Its supervision of projects is well organized and projects
are visited regularly. Collection problems are dealt with promptly.

30.         The future plans of lClCl call for the development of a high-technology commercial
bank with automated teller machines and other uptodate banking systems and a share registry
company. lClCl has already opened an investment bank with J. P. Morgan,-' and an asset
management company (mutual funds). This is in line with its diversification from strictly
development banking into other profitable areas of financial services. ICICI is thus getting a
head start which should be of great benefit as more competition in short- and long-term lending
arises.

C.    Financial Performance and Resource Mobilization of the lClCl

      1.     Operating Results

31.          lClCl's profitability during the period from 1985 to 1992/93 was maintained at a
satisfactory level (see Table 2 for the highlights and Appendixes 4, 5 and 6 for actual and
projected financial statements). Interest income from loan portfolio grew annually at a
compound rate of 26 per cent from As 1,829 million to Rs 11,879 million. It is projected to rise
to Rs 22,330 in 1995/96. The net income from operation before provision for income tax
increased steadily over the period under review from Rs 557 million in 1985 to Rs 2,336 million

   in 1992/93. It is projected to rise to Rs 5,604 million by 1995/96. The growth in operating
   income was supported by the varying interest spread levels from loan portfolio ranging from 1.4
   per cent1' to 4 per cent. The recent upward adjustment of the interest spread was due to the
   deregulation of domestic interest rates in 1990/91 and the increasing demand for rupee loans.
   However, competition from commercial banks and other financing institutions pressured ICICI's
   earnings spread to reduce during 1992/93. In terms of overall operation the earnings spread
   from the total portfolio ranged from 2.2 per cent to 4.9 per cent over the period under review,
   although the spread declined slightly in 1992/93 to 4.8 per cent as a consequence of market
   competition from commercial banks, other financing institutions, the ebbing market for foreign
   currency loan projects and the increasing cost of borrowed funds. The earnings spread is
   expected to increase to 8.3 per cent in 1995/96. Although the income from non-project
   financing such as leasing, asset credit and credit lines, capital gains, merchant banking and
   trusteeship showed annual growth rate of 30 per cent, the income from project financing (i.e.,
   loan portfolio) was the major source of earnings with an average base of about 92 per cent of
   total investment assets, including rupee and foreign currency loans, yielding an average of 12.5
   per cent earnings during the period being reviewed.

         ICICI has been achieving the covenanted 2 per cent per annum interest spread except in
         three years, i.e., 1988/89, 1989/90 and 1990/91.
                                               8

32. - Administrative and general expenses were held at less than 1 per cent of the
average total assets, except in 1991/92 when the rate exceeded the 1 per cent level which is
considered to be unusual. In terms of amount, however, administrative costs more than
doubled in 1992/93 signalling the adjustment required of an expanding operation.

       2.      Financial Position

33. The financial status of ICICI was complemented by the sufficient cash and other
cash assets generating the current ratio ranging from 1.7:1 to 2.8:1. This is projected to rise
to 3.3:1 in 1995/96, The collection rate of ICICI in 1992/93 at 82.4 per cent of the current dues
improved from the 80.8 per cent mark the year before. The total assets grew at a compound
rate of close to 25 per cent annually from 1985 to 1992/93 indicating acceleration of fund
mobilization. ICICI was able to maintain a debt-service coverage of more than the required 1.1:1
ratio except in two years (1987/88 and 1988/89). The decline in 1992/93 debt-service ratio to
1 .2:1 from the previous year's 1.5:1 needs monitoring to ensure adherence to the existing loan
covenanted ratio. lClCl complied with the Bank's covenant of 12:1 debt to equity ratio by
maintaining adequate capital to match long-term borrowings. It is projected that debt to equity
ratio will decline further from 7.1:1 in 1992/93 to 5.7:1 in 1995/96.

       3.      Resource Mobilization

34. The fund management of ICICI is characterized by substantial investment in rupee
and foreign currency borrowings supplemented with equity shares and debentures. Rupee
resource mobilization has been increasing considerably as rupee loan approvals during the
period under review escalated to As 27.4 billion in 1992/93 from only about As 3 billion in 1985.
Foreign currency loan approvals declined to As 5.8 billion in 1992/93. The recent depreciation
of the rupee viz-a-viz the US dollar is the principal reason for the slow mobilization of foreign
exchange funds by lClCl. In addition, the impact of the Government's liberalized import policy
which allows rupee payments to liquidate the importation of capital goods created a natural
demand for rupee funds. Due to the shift of the loan portfolio to rupee loans, ICICI is expected
to reduce its foreign currency resources in favor of local currency funding. This shift, although
of medium-term duration, would cause non-utilization of the ongoing foreign currency
borrowings of Idol. !' Loan approvals of projects for foreign exchange declined in 1991 /92 to
As 8.4 billion equivalent from As 10.4 billion the year before. This trend continued in 1992/93
when approvals for foreign currency loans slipped to Rs 5.8 billion. In contrast, rupee loans
escalated from Rs 17.5 billion in 1991/92 to As 27.4 billion in 1992/93. Similarly, investment
portfolio also grew at a vigorous pace to As 10.8 billion in 1992/93 from only As 3.0 billion the
year before. The commitments for foreign exchange loans declined during the same period but
disbursements remained stable at about As 7.0 billion equivalent. The commitments and
disbursements on rupee loans and investments accelerated, indicating greater demand for
rupees.

35.            ICICI is in the process of adding commercial banking to its diversified financial
activities. This move indicates expansion of the resource base from public depositors at



       This was noted in the reported slow disbursement performance of the Bank's second
       ICICI loan (No. 1072-IND). Due to this development, lClCl was constrained to request
       the Bank for the cancellation of half the loan amount equivalent to $60.0 million of the
       ongoing Second IClCl Loan.
                                                  9

relatively low cost to mobilization from industrial borrowers. This move, although a good source
of low-cost resources, will increase the administrative as well as the staff requirements of ICICI.
The effect of this will have to be carefully weighed against the current management cost of
operating a commercial bank bearing in mind the training needs of the staff to prepare them for
commercial banking operation.

        4.      Quality and Size of Portfolio

36. The total portfolio of ICICI, consisting primarily of project loans and debentures
and equity investments, increased at 23 per cent compounded annually from As 16,958 million
in 1985 to As 87,014 million in 1992/93. The loan portfolio on foreign currency financing of
projects is expected to experience lower growth because of the recent policy reform on import
liberalization, comprising the lifting of restriction on the importation of capital assets and the free
conversion of rupees to foreign exchange currency. Rupee loans, however, are expected to
continue to increase since importers of capital goods can use rupees to buy foreign currency
without Government restrictions. Loan approvals in the portfolio have been widely distributed
throughout the industry with the exception of shipping. Major sectors are chemicals, metal
products, basic metal industries and electrical equipment. The balanced portfolio of ICICI has
been instrumental in assisting industrial development in India. As of 1992, subprojects
accounted for about $30 million of exports, incremental employment of 11,662 jobs and overall
value added of about $1,685 million. New technology was added to India through about 66 per
cent of the subprojects financed under the Loan. The quality of the loan portfolio is satisfactory,
although there are signs of an increasing rate of arrears among the outstanding loans.

        5.     Arrears and Collection Performance

37.             The collection efficiency of lClCl was about 72.1 per cent of the total amount due
in 1992/93, slightly up from 71.5 per cent in 1991/92. Of the total current dues, the collection
rate was 82.4 per cent in fiscal year 1993, up from 80.8 per cent the year before. The rate of
arrears to total loans outstanding in 1993 however, increased to 5.1 per cent of the outstanding
loans from 4.4 per cent in 1992 due mainly to the effect of the worldwide economic recession
which created a temporary cash flow set back in the country's industrial/manufacturing sector.
The increase in the rate of arrears deserves monitoring. ICICI's policy of writing off long
overdue accounts and its effort to assist in rescheduling the accounts of sub-borrowers
experiencing operational difficulties is prudent and often leads to a better portfolio quality.
ICICI's current practice of writing off specific debts or accounts which, on the basis of present
available information, are fully or partially irrecoverable has eliminated the need to provide
accounting allowance for doubtful loan accounts (see Appendix 7 for detailed arrears and
collection data).

D.     Performance of Subprojects

       1.      Overall Performance

38.           The operating performance of the 86 subprojects has been a mixture of positive
and negative operating results. From the latest financial data gathered from those subprojects



       For lending to shipping, ICICI and others have established a new Shipping Credit and
       Investment Company of India (SCICI).
                                                10

with available information, of the 12 AFL subprojects, two suffered operating losses during 1989
to 1991 of which one reported a recovery in 1992; another subproject started commercial
operation only in March 1993; yet another, a petrochemical firm merged with a similar company;
while an automotive firm abandoned the project due to liquidity and marketing problems; of the
74 BFL subprojects, some 30 companies had experienced negative operation caused by delays
in project completion, locational and security problems, stiff market competition, poor
management, labor strikes, marketing problems and, in some cases, underutilized production
capacity. From the interviews conducted on ten sample subprojects, a common concern was
the current worldwide economic recession which is cutting down production to as much as half
or less than half of what it was expected to achieve. Most industries in the country, including
the subprojects, were constrained to reduce operating costs to maintain a financially viable
operation (see Appendix 8).

39. The operating performance of those subprojects operating at a loss should be
closely monitored by ICICI to bring them back to a profitable operation. It is likely that the
economic recession currently being experienced worldwide will further slow down the financial
recovery of these firms. A monitoring system designed to support clients in financial difficulty
is already in place at ICICI. Companies with problems who availed themselves of the Project's
credit facility are regularly being monitored and the action taken is recorded for follow-up action.
lClCI should further strengthen this monitoring system to include immediate action required for
the assistance of sub-borrowers in distress. However, the infusion of more funds is not
necessarily the answer to the needs of some troubled companies. lClCl should be prepared
to assess and address other problems such as market deficiency and operating and
management constraints.

       2.      Subproject Arrear Situation

40. The arrears experience in the Project subloans was satisfactory. Only 1 out of
the 12 AFL subloans incurred arrears of over six months, equivalent to 0.7 per cent of the total
loan amount for AFL. In the 74 BFL subprojects only 9 have arrears which range from less than
3 months to over 6 months and represent little more than 3 per cent of the total amount of
subloans approved. ICICI is closely monitoring the repayment trend of its client borrowers and
is servicing the companies' financial operation as part of its financial marketing strategy. This
monitoring system, one of the more positive actions of ICICI, has resulted in a low arrears
situation among the Project subloans and an overall strong portfolio.

       3.      Operational Performance of Ten Sub projects Visited

41. The PEM visited ten subprojects, about 12 per cent of the total subprojects
supported under the Loan and classified as BFL Two of the subprojects were new, three
companies had borrowed for balancing-modernization-replacement, and five were for expansion.
All of the ten subprojects were uptodate in their accounts with ICICI and one had already fully
repaid its account. The ten firms visited included a construction service, a plastic processing
industry, a steel forging company, an automobile components firm, a two-wheel motorcycle
assembler, a ferrite magnets manufacturer, an auto safety glass producer, an electrical cable
manufacturer, an electrical transformer manufacturer and a bearing producer. Two subprojects
are located in New Delhi, four in Bombay and another four in Pune. Table 3 gives financial and
economic information on the subprojects visited.





                                                          11

   42. All of the subprojects visited indicated that the items of equipment purchased
   from the subloans were being utilized and contributing to the overall operation of the firm.
   Although a few items required additional equipment to fully utilize capacity, this did not disturb
   the continuous operation of production facilities. The total number of employees/workers in the
   plants ranged from 195 to 2,300 of whom women ranged from none to as many as 80 persons.
   With the exception of the bearing manufacturer, all the subprojects visited were profitable in
   1992/93. However, the present economic recession is obliging the subprojects to operate at
   only half their normal capacity. Appendix 9 provides information on the operational performance
   of the subprojects visited by PEM.

   a/ Majority of the data are from 1992 operations, a few were from 1993 and 1991 actual operations.



   E.       Socioeconomic Aspects of Subprojects

   43. As shown in the PCR, the total cost of subprojects financed under the Loan
   amounted to some Rs 50,702 million ($1,644 million equivalent). The 55 subprojects, for which
   comparative employment data were available, had generated additional 33,384 jobs (8,625 from
   the AFL subloans and 24,759 in the BFL class) as of 1992. Average incremental investment cost
   per worker varied between subprojects, and ranged from Rs 3,300 to as much as As 31.9 million
   in 1992. The new jobs created helped to reduce unemployment and benefitted the workers'
   families. The value added realized in 1992 by the subprojects, which were stimulating the
   economy in the communities in which they were located, ranged from As 0.34 million to As 7.8
   million. The total value added in 1992 for 71 companies for which data were available was
   estimated at $1,685 million. For these subprojects capacity utilization ranged from 12 per cent
   to 133 per cent with an average of about 67 per cent. Only nine subprojects were export-
   oriented and the remainder were either import substituting or domestic-market oriented
   enterprises. From the information gathered on the subprojects visited, only 2 per cent to 10 per
   cent of production was for export. Many of the companies visited expressed their intention of
   increasing their export sales after the recession period (see Appendix 10 for details).

   F.       Women in Development

   44.            As an employer, ICICI provides an equal opportunity to men and women in every
   area of activity. No discrimination is made on grounds of gender in regard to promotion,
                                                12

mobility, and area of work. Over the last ten years (1984-1993), the number of professional
women has increased both in absolute and in percentage terms; the percentage of professional
women in the total number of professional staff in ICICI increased from 20 per cent to 26 per
cent. In case of support staff, the percentage of women in the total staff strength increased from
37 per cent to 48 per cent. The general procedure regarding merit and promotion is on a
uniform basis. By 31 December 1992, women had nsen to the senior levels of General Manager
(1), Deputy General Manager (1), Assistant General Manager (8), Manager (8) and Deputy
Manager (6), on the strength of their performance.

45. The impact of the ICICI Loan Project on women has been limited in those
subprojects engaged in heavy and medium industries because almost all of the tasks in these
industries require skills that have traditionally been delegated to men and have very limited slots
for females. The PEM gathered from the field that women are employed in most of the light
industries supported by the subprojects, but no actual figures were provided on the number of
women employed directly resulting from the implementation of the Bank's loan to lClCl.

G.      Environmental Im pacts and Control

46. ICICI and the Bank require that sub-borrowers comply with all environmental rules
and regulations of India. The PEM noted that the sample of companies visited were well
informed about environmental rules for their plants, and that they applied the rules by recycling
water, controlling dust and monitoring outside air quality; this was checked as often as monthly
by environmental officials.

H.     Gestation and Sustainability

47. lClCl is a well-organized and well-run DFI. It has a satisfactory portfolio, good
collection and follow-up procedures and should have no problem in sustaining its operations
at the present level. It should, however, be cautious not to move too fast into new areas,
since this might over-extend its management capabilities to supervise and control the new
subsidiaries.


                              V. KEY ISSUES FOR THE FUTURE

48. Several issues and questions were identified for the future. First, to meet
competition, lClCl is at present sethng up new subsidiaries in investment and commercial
banking. These subsidiaries will need to have excellent staff and qualified management to bring
them into profitable operation. This is a time-consuming and difficult task. It should be careful
not to spread its top management too thin and so lose control of its new operations. With
decentralization ICICI is adjusting to a new pattern of operations that should allow senior
management more time to supervise the new subsidiaries and take appropriate action to ensure
successful implementation. Second, lClCl's overall lending pattern has shifted away from
foreign exchange loans. The Bank will need to structure new types of lending, i.e., local
currency (swaps) or shorter maturities to be of any assistance in the DFI area in India. Future
lending could go to other financial institutions like commercial banks, leasing companies, etc.
Lending will be more oriented towards the privatization of companies, loans without government



       Investment banking and commercial banking operations.
                                                 13
guarantees and as mentioned above swaps so that foreign exchange lending is immediately
converted into local currency funding.


                                       VI. CONCLUSIONS

A.     Overall Assessment               -

49. The Project satisfactorily achieved its objective of providing foreign exchange
resources to support ICICI's lending program, mainly for modernization and expansion of private
medium-sized enterprises and for new industrial projects designed to introduce new technology
in India. The overall impact of the subprojects financed under the Project has been satisfactory.
The Project is considered generally successful.

B.      Lessons Learned

50.            The development financing institutions should make realistic estimates of project
implementation schedules. They should closely examine how outside factors such as import
duty, possible devaluation of currency and price increases on basic items might cause cost
overruns in projects.

51.            ICICI needs to be careful about problem loans and to ensure that correct follow-
up is made in a timely manner and at the appropriate level. Collection ratios and arrears must
be watched closely and proper follow-up instituted to maintain and if possible improve collection
efficiency.

C.     Follow-up Actions

52. There is a need for the Bank to closely monitor: (I) the effects on lClCl of the
various new subsidiaries which it is starting; (ii) lClCl's financial performance, especially problem
loans and collection ratios; (iii) that ICICI's portfolio performance does not deteriorate; (iv) that
subproject implementation schedules are more realistically established in future loans; (v) that
subprojects continue to abide by the environmental rules and regulations of India; and (vi) that
the policy dialogue intended to ensure the maintenance of a satisfactory financial environment
for lClCl and other borrowers is continued through future Bank lending programs to India.

              OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF 10 SUBPROJECTS VISITED

1. Table 1 at the end of this Appendix presents some relevant finahcial and
economic information used in assessing the performance of the 10 subprojects visited by the
PEM.

A.     Auto Safety Glass Firm

2. This subproject requested foreign financing of $515,000 to import new machinery
and glass temper heater equipment. The firm produces mostly automotive safety glass. The
company has a regular maintenance schedule for all its machinery and equipment. The
subproject incurred a cost overrun of about Rs 5.0 million due to additions of certain
complementary cutting equipment and other indigenous plant and machinery. A delay of nine
months in obtaining an import license and in the shipment of machinery was experienced.

3. The firm has no arrears with ICICI at present and has been satisfactorily meeting
its current dues although arrears were experienced in the past due to capacity underutilization.
The subproject created some 57 additional jobs for men but none for women. The current
capacity utilization of 75 per cent, with some 2 per cent of the volume exported to Bangladesh
and Sri Lanka, has realized a return on average equity of about 20 per cent in 1993 with annual
profit of Rs 5.0 million from sales of Rs 152.3 million and assets of Rs 63.4 million. The
company has a recent debt to equity ratio of 0.44 and 2.5 current ratio. With 195 employees
the firm realized value added of Rs 17.7 million.

4. The social responsibility of the company was demonstrated by sponsoring civic
projects such as an eyesight clinic project and the education of employees' children as well as
other needy and deserving children through Lion's International. The company is providing staff
benefits in terms of free health care, health insurance, medical facilities for employees/workers
and their immediate family members and sponsored education for staff and children. The firm
also contributed some funds for the improvement of railway approaches and in the resettlement
of slum/squatter dwellers. The subproject has not experienced environmental problem.

B.     Plastic Processing Company

5. The company requested a foreign currency loan of $307,000 to set up a new
facility with new imported machinery to produce multi-layer plastic sheets. The company
manufactures hi-technology plastic products from cups to PVC pipes, fittings, chairs and
television, radio, air conditioner and automobile and motorbikes plastic parts and components.
Maintenance schedule is part of the overall operational activity of the company plant. The
subproject was completed four months behind the expected time of completion at appraisal
despite the reduction in scope which explained the Rs 3.0 million cost underrun.

6. The company has been meeting its dues from ICICI regularly and has not
encountered any problems in its operation except for the global recession currently being
experienced. The subproject has registered actual capacity utilization of 70 per cent during its
initial operation. The firm has exported only about 7 per cent of the achieved capacity with the

                                                                                     Page 2

domestic market absorbing 93 per cent. Latest annual profit realized reached Rs 79.8 million
from sales of Rs 1,638.5 million with total assets of Rs 1,358.7 million. The firm recorded a 19
per cent return on average equity in 1992. The rise in debt to equity ratio of 1 .06 was due to
the Project subloan amount. The current ratio registered 1 .82 during the initial operation of the
completed subproject. The value added achieved in recent period amounted to Rs 446.4 million
using about 1,200 employees in its operation.

7. No environmental problem has been noted in the operation of the company with
the addition of the subproject. The scrap and other waste materials are sold to a manufacturer
of plastic raw materials for recycling. It has been noted that the Government environment
agency is regularly conducting inspection of all industrial firms to pursue effective
implementation of environmental anti-pollution measures. The company is providing welfare
benefits to its employees/workers in health and medical insurance, non-interest bearing housing
loan and selective travel assistance.

C.     Steel Forging Company

8. The firm applied for foreign currency loan of $2.7 million to finance the
modernization of its steel forging screw press lines. The company manufactures forged steel
