B. Project Description

     (i) Rationale: In spite of financial sector liberalization and associated policy and regulatory reforms to
     promote increased participation in housing finance and development, the housing shortage in India
     remained critical, especially for low-income households (LIHs). It was estimated that India's housing
     shortage was as high as 40 million units, suggesting that more than 200 million people were living in
     chronically poor housing conditions or on the streets. Although "shelter for all" was the overarching goal
     of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997­2002), this was not achieved by 2000 and was not expected to be
     achieved by the end of the Ninth Plan period in 2002. Since over 90% of the housing need was from
     low-income families, these families were most directly impacted by unacceptable living standards and
     the poor quality of life in all of India's urban centers. Lack of basic services such as water supply,
     drainage, sanitation, and electricity also negatively impacted the productivity and incomes of poor
     households, especially those who worked in their homes. Since the major source of housing finance for
     LIHs was their own meager savings and family assets, the principal constraint to the ability of them to
     improve their housing and living conditions was the absence of affordable credit for housing. Although
     various community-based financial institutions (CFIs) and nongovernment organizations (NGOs)
     assisted low-income families to mobilize their savings and have extended loans for housing construction
     and improvement, these efforts were extremely small when compared with the total housing finance
     demand of LIHs.

     (ii) Impact: The major intended impact of the Project was to support human development by making
     available resources for assisting poor families with one or more income earners to gain access to
     housing finance from formal and informal housing finance institutions, especially CFIs and NGOs. The
     major benefit was the catalytic impact on improving the access of LIHs to housing finance, and the
     accompanying policy reform agenda that promoted sustainable mechanisms for delivery of housing
     finance at market rates, strengthen institutional capacity of housing finance institutions (HFIs) in both
     the formal and informal sectors, and facilitate housing investment. ADB loans of $300 million were
     expected to result in housing investment of about $517 million by leveraging project funds with
     beneficiaries' own investments and investments by the borrowers. The Project was expected to
     increase the capacity of the major lenders in the public and private sectors and and NGOs to respond
     to housing needs of low-income borrowers and was going to directly benefit about 270,000 LIHs, or
     over 1.3 million people. The recycling of repayment proceeds was expected to maximize the impact of
     the ADB loan resulting in more than 570,000 housing loans benefiting about 2.7 million people over the
     loan period. There was a basic linkage between improved housing and human welfare; therefore,
     human development was expected to be enhanced by the increased availability of housing finance for
     LIHs. The Project was expected to have an immediate impact on the welfare of low-income families who
     presently had to pay interest rates of between 5 to 10% per month. Thus, many impoverished families
     were expected, for the first time, have access to affordable, yet market-based housing finance. Critical
     urban infrastructure and services provided under the slum networking component of the Project, and
     institutional capacities were to be strengthened to improve the living conditions of families in slum areas
     across India.

     (iii) Objectives or Expected Outcomes: The objectives of the Project were to (i) increase access of
     LIHs to market-based housing finance by increasing and broadening the finance channels of both
     informal and formal HFIs; (ii) reduce poverty by improving infrastructure and services in slum areas and
     financing innovative low-income housing subprojects; and (iii) expand the lending operations of housing
     finance companies (HFCs) to include a greater proportion of loans to LIHs. The overall thrust of the
     Project was to promote market-based lending without subsidies, and the target beneficiary group was
     LIHs.

     (iv) Components and/or Outputs: The Project comprised credit, policy reform, and institutional
     building components. The credit component consisted of 3 parts: part A: lending to LIHs through
     intermediaries such as , NGOs, public and private enterprises, and state and local bodies; part B:
     reducing poverty through slum networking and home-work place subprojects; and part C: increasing
                                                                                                           3


   lending to LIHs through formal HFIs. The four primary borrowers included Housing and Urban
   Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO), National Housing Bank (NHB), Housing Development
   Finance Corporation Limited (HDFC), and ICICI Bank Limited (ICICI Bank). The ADB loan of $300
   million was expected to be utilized as follows: (a) HUDCO ­ $100 million for onlending $25 million to
   and NGOs, $20 million to public and private enterprises, $10 million to state and local bodies, $30
   million to LIHs through retail lending, and $15 million to support slum networking and home-work place
   subprojects; (b) NHB ­ $40 million for refinancing HFC loans to LIHs and ; (c) HDFC ­ $80 million for
   onlending $5 million to and NGOs, $20 million to public and private enterprises, $10 million to state and
   local bodies, and $45 million to individual LIHs; and (d) ICICI Bank ­ $80 million for onlending $10
   million to and NGOs, $20 million to public and private enterprises, $10 million to state and local bodies,
   and $40 million to individual LIHs. The loans were provided as lines of credit to finance the entire
   foreign-exchange cost and part of the local currency cost (58% of the total project cost). The loan
   proceeds were to be onlent to subborrowers in local currency with the foreign-exchange risk borne by
   the four borrowers. They were required to hedge the exchange risk through swap arrangements
   acceptable to ADB. The policy reform and institutional building elements included the following: (a)
   strengthen linkages between the formal and informal sectors; (b) raise corporate governance standards
   for public institutions; (c) implement foreclosure regulations and provisions; (d) improve the mortgage
   registration system; and (e) expand the capital market for housing finance. These were to be
   implemented through NHB and ICICI Bank.

C. Evaluation of Design and Implementation

   (i) Relevance of design and formulation: The Project design was relevant at appraisal. It targeted the
   LIH sector for assistance as it had the least access to housing finance and that available was at high
   interest rates. The Project was in line with the Government's Ninth Plan that targeted to reduce the
   housing shortage by constructing 2 million units (700,000 in urban areas) annually over the five-year
   plan period (1997-2002) for which the investment requirement was estimated at Rs1,500 billion ($37.5
   billion). The Project was also in line with ADB's Urban Sector Strategy for India which emphasized, in
   relation to the housing subsector: (a) strengthened linkages between formal and informal housing
   finance as a means to increase the availability and affordability of housing loans to LIHs; (ii) promoting
   microcredit programs for housing loans and home-based, income-generating activities, and support low-
   income shelter schemes; and (iii) providing technical advice and expertise in the establishment of a
   secondary mortgage market as a means to increase the availability of capital for housing finance. The
   Project was the second loan project to address the financial, institutional, and regulatory constraints to
   increasing the availability of housing finance to LIHs. The PCR stated that there were some issues that
   were not suitably analyzed in the appraisal and formulation of the Project. These related to (a) the
   prevailing market rate vis-`a-vis the cost of ADB funds; (b) risks and constraints in lending through some
   of the channels including capacity constraints of and NGOs in lending funds to LIHs and the high
   intermediation costs of HFI lending through these institutions; (c) suitability of NHB's refinance
   operations for directing credit to LIHs; and (d) absence of an appropriate definition in the appraisal of
   what constituted an LIH (paras. 15, 16, and 69 of the PCR).

   (ii) Project Outputs (or conditions in the case of program loans): During the period March 2000 to
   October 2001, the interest rates for rupee-denominated loans in the domestic market declined due to
   increased liquidity in the market. This reduced the competitiveness of ADB funds. AAA corporations
   could raise rupee funds in the domestic market at about 10.0 to 10.2% whereas, the ADB loan rate was
   11.0 to 11.2% in rupee terms based on suitable swap arrangements. As a consequence, HUDCO and
   HDFC decided not to proceed with their respective ADB loans (Nos. 1760-IND and 1758-IND,
   respectively). This necessitated a change in project scope and implementation arrangements as
   approved by the ADB Board in November 2001. Thus, only 2 loans resulted under the Project i.e., $40
   million loan to NHB (Loan 1759-IND) and $80 million loan to ICICI Bank (Loan 1761-IND) (reduction in
   the original project scope by 40%) and these two were to be implemented in accordance with the
   original arrangements. However, NHB decided to cancel $32.60 million out of its loan of $40 million i.e.,
   about 81.5% of its loan (according to the PCR, NHB fixed the rupee cost of ADB funds through a
   structured swap that did not allow NHB to benefit from the falling domestic rates). Thus, as much as
4


    $212.60 million out of the original loan of $300 million (about 71%) was not ultimately used for the main
    Project purpose of assisting LIHs. On the subsequently changed project scope basis, loan utilization
    increased, but only up to 73% for assisting LIHs. In addition, the withdrawal of the loan of $100 million
    by HUDCO prevented the envisaged Project support for slum networking and home-work place
    subprojects and the Project from contributing much for poverty reduction. Only the ICICI Bank loan of
    $80 million was fully used up for providing approximately 25,730 subloans to LIHs benefiting 129,000
    persons. The small portion of the loan used up by NHB (about $7.40 million) resulted in about 2,830
    subloans for LIHs benefiting 14,000 persons i.e., a total of 28,560 assisted LIHs benefiting 143,000
    persons or only about 10.5% of the 270,000 LIHs and 11% of the 1.3 million persons expected to
    directly benefit under the Project (with recycling of loan proceeds, the Project expected to help 570,000
    LIHs benefiting 2.7 million persons). The success of the loan to ICICI Bank, whereas two loans were
    withdrawn (HUDCO and HDFC) and one was hardly used (NHB), appeared to be due to giving
    subloans on a floating rate basis, lending directly to LIHs (about 85% of the loan) and thus avoiding the
    high intermediation costs of the intermediaries, tighter risk management techniques, and ADB making
    necessary changes in implementation arrangements that enabled full loan utilization.

    With regard to outputs on policy and institutional development components, some progress appeared to
    have been made, albeit with some delay and with some remaining yet to be fully implemented and
    enforced at the time of the PCR. Their status was as follows: (a) strengthening linkages between formal
    and informal sectors: NHB's CFI refinance window did not receive any proposals from HFCs. NHB
    therefore started direct lending to and NGOs, and in the case of ICICI Bank­it developed expertise on
    microcredit lending, risk management team vetted all proposals from a risk perspective, adapted
    procedures to meet specific needs of , and implemented a risk sharing agreement with ; (b) raise
    corporate governance standards for public institutions: NHB's board of directors met regularly,
    constituted an audit committee comprising non-executive directors, and an executive committee which
    met regularly, and constituted a risk management advisory committee, and in the case of ICICI Bank­it
    put in place a sound corporate governance structure; (c) implement foreclosure regulations and
    provisions: NHB Act was amended in 2000 to provide for recovery of overdue loans, and the
    Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act 2002
    was enacted and provided for easier procedures relating to mortgage foreclosure by HFIs; (d) improve
    mortgage registration system: this covenant was complied with only in principle with NHB and ICICI
    Bank facilitating the establishment and participating in the working group that prepared a draft report for
    the Government in 2006 with the PCR being unable to get an update on the status of that report; and
    (e) expand the capital market for housing finance: a feasibility study, business plan, and investor
    prospectus were being prepared under an ADB TA1 approved in 2005 with the aim of assisting the
    development of policies, regulations and a mechanism for issuance of "true sale" residential mortgage-
    backed securities (MBSs) through establishment of a credit enhancement agency and/or secondary
    mortgage institution.

    (iii) Project Cost, Disbursements, Borrower Contribution, and Conformance to Schedule (as
    relevant to project performance): The original Project was estimated to cost $517 million equivalent,
    of which $61 million was the foreign exchange cost and $456 million equivalent was the local currency
    cost. The total cost was to be financed by ADB providing $300 million ($61 million in foreign exchange
    and $239 million equivalent in local currency) or 58%, beneficiaries providing $146 million equivalent in
    local currency or 28%, and the 4 executing agencies, namely, HUDCO, NHB, HDFC, and the ICICI
    Bank providing the balance $71 million equivalent in local currency or 14%. The ADB loan of $300
    million was to be utilized by the 4 executing agencies as detailed under item B (iv) above. As mentioned
    earlier, with the withdrawal of HUDCO and HDFC loans and change of project scope, the total Project
    cost was reformulated to cost $197 million ($22 million in foreign exchange and $175 million in local
    currency). ADB loans to NHB and ICICI Bank totaling $120 million, and their intended purposes
    remained the same as the original Project. Out of these two loans, only about 73% was ultimately
    utilized. The PCR did not provide data on contributions made by the borrowers and beneficiaries

                                                                                                                    5


    towards meeting the project cost. Hence, the actual project cost at completion could not be quantified.
    The Project was to be implemented over 5 years (2000/2001 to 2005/2006) and completed by 31
    December 2006. The utilized portions of the ICICI Bank and NHB loans were disbursed in full over 5
    years (2002-2007). The NHB loan became effective slightly ahead of the due date in February 2002
    while, the effectiveness of the ICICI Bank loan was delayed by about 9 months and became effective in
    December 2002 after 4 extensions. The terminal dates were extended once (NHB from February 2006
    to June 2007 and ICICI Bank from December 2006 to June 2007). The NHB loan was closed on
    schedule on 30 June 2007 while that of ICICI Bank was closed on 10 October 2007 with one extension.

    (iv) Implementation Arrangements, Conditions and Covenants, related Technical Assistance,
    and Procurement and Consultant Performance: The 4 borrowers (HUDCO, NHB, HDFC, and ICICI)
    were the executing agencies for the Project. All 4 Borrowers were required to submit the first two
    subprojects under each applicable onlending channel or component to ADB for review and approval. All
    subprojects to be financed under the slum networking and home-work place components of part B
    required ADB approval. After the change of project scope, these implementation arrangements
    continued to be the same for NHB and ICICI Bank. As to the status of conditions and covenants, NHB
    was generally in compliance with covenants except delays in submission of auditor's reports on use of
    loan proceeds, adequacy of accounting and internal control procedures, and compliance with financial
    covenants (debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) falling to 0.70 in FY2007 against the covenanted
    minimum of 1.1 times). ICICI Bank was also generally in compliance with covenants except delays in
    submission of auditor's reports on use of loan proceeds, adequacy of accounting and internal control
    procedures, and compliance with financial covenants (the ratios however were within the covenanted
    limits). The Project did not include any TA from ADB. The PCR did not comment on the procurement
    procedures followed in respect to use of loan proceeds.

    (v) Performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency: The performance of three of the borrowers
    and executing agencies i.e., HUDCO, HDFC and NHB were not satisfactory. All three of them were
    involved in the design and formulation of the Project, but HUDCO and HDFC decided not to proceed
    with the loans allocated to them i.e., total of $180 million or 60% of the original ADB loan of $300
    million. NHB proceeded with its loan of $40 million but used only $7.40 million (18.5%) and canceled the
    balance $32.6 million (81%). Thus, as much as $212.6 million (71%) of the original ADB total loan was
    not ultimately used for intended purposes. The situation improved under the revised project scope basis
    with the non-utilization status reducing to 27%. The PCR's reason for non-utilization of their loans was
    the interest rates issue as discussed earlier. However, ICICI Bank, which had the same terms and
    conditions as the other three, fully utilized its loan of $80 million or 26.6% of the total ADB loan of $300
    million. As mentioned earlier, in the case of the ICICI Bank loan, ADB helped by making necessary
    changes in implementation arrangements that enabled full loan utilization. It was not clear from the PCR
    why similar assistance was not extended to the other three borrowers to ensure full utilization of their
    loans.2 It appeared that HUDCO, HDFC, and NHB should have played more proactive roles to ensure
    greater utilization of their loans. Perhaps, they could have tried harder to mitigate that interest rate
    difference (only about 1.0%) through reducing other costs and/or adopting innovative lending methods
    as done by ICICI Bank. By not doing so, an opportunity was lost to assist much needed LIHs with their
    housing needs and also help with slum networking and home-work place subprojects for poverty
    reduction. Also, implementation of the policy and institutional development actions were delayed and
    some of them remained to be fully implemented and enforced at the time of the PCR.

    (vi) Performance of the Asian Development Bank: The performance of ADB was also not
    satisfactory. Since the ADB loan interest rate was market-based and, therefore subject to market
    volatility, the Project's design and formulation should have had inbuilt flexibility and mechanisms in

2
    In this regard, the counter argument of the India Resident Mission is as follows: "Unlike ICICI Bank, HDFC, and
    HUDCO decided to withdraw from the Project before signing, based on their institutional views on the interest rate
    issues and long term viability. Since the HDFC and HUDCO loans were not implemented, the question of ADB
    providing flexibility as in the case of the ICICI Bank loan (by making changes in implementation arrangements to
    address market challenges faced during implementation) did not arise.
 6


     terms of procedures and interest rates to the borrowers to have adjusted quickly to changes in the
     economic environment which probably could have prevented such a large scale non-utilization of the
     original total loan (71%). The interest rate issue was known at the time of the appraisal but the risk was
     underestimated according to the PCR, para. 16. Also, ADB should have taken steps at commencement
     of project implementation to incorporate the needed flexibility to react to the changes in the market
     place that had taken place after the project was approved by ADB. That would have prevented HUDCO
     and HDFC from withdrawing their loans, and NHB canceling a large portion of its loan. The fact that the
     ICICI Bank used up fully its loan allocation of $80 million showed such flexibility could have made a
     difference and helped a more effective use of the considerable resources spent by the
     borrowers/executing agencies and ADB in processing and implementing this Project. The change of
     project scope appeared to have been the easiest course of action to have been taken. The PCR also
     identified some defects in ADB's project formulation that led to delays in project implementation (item C
     (i) items (a) to (d) above). The subsequent change of project scope resulted in greater loan utilization up
     to 73% and reducing non-utilization to 27%.

D. Evaluation of Performance

     (i) Relevance: The PCR did not rate the Project as originally approved by the Board (i.e., total loans of
     $300 million). It rated, on an individual basis, only the two loans that proceeded under the change of
     project scope basis totaling loans of $120 million i.e., NHB loan as "partly relevant" (para. 73) and the
     ICICI Bank loan as "relevant" (para. 74). IED was of the view that the Project, as approved by the Board
     comprising the entire loan of $300 million, should have been taken into account in making this rating not
     just the two loans that used some portion of the original total loan (all four loans were included in the
     Project Framework). IED needed to judge the performance of the Project as originally designed,
     appraised, and approved by the ADB Board. Such an approach was considered necessary to find out
     what went wrong with the original approval and whether there were any lessons to be learnt that would
     help to improve future Bank operations. This was the first housing development project in India where
     market-based interest rates were tried out without cross-subsidization, and the first project that focused
     only on assisting LIHs. Also, other concepts were being tried out, example, using intermediaries to
     reach LIHs, developing linkages between the formal and informal sectors, and providing market-based
     lending for slum clearance. Therefore, there were lessons to be learnt from these rather innovative
     lending schemes that were being tried out by ADB.

     Although the Project was relevant at appraisal, its relevance declined subsequently with HDFC and
     HUDCO withdrawing from participation. Thus, much as 71% (including NHB's poor loan utilization
     status) of the original loan of $300 million was not utilized for the intended purposes. Therefore, the
     main objective of the original Project which was to increase in the level of credit availability, at
     affordable costs, to assist a large number of LIHs did not materialize. Thus, the Project's envisaged
     outcomes and impacts were minimal. In these circumstances, IED rated the Project as "partly relevant".
     Perhaps, the borrowers/executing agencies and ADB should have jointly reformulated the Project at
     commencement of project implementation taking into account early warning signals to adjust the project
     parameters to meet the changing economic circumstances. That would have probably increased the
     prospects of greater loan utilization and greater achievement of the project objectives, outcomes and
     impacts as well as maintained project relevance during the entire project cycle. ICICI Bank's
     performance was a good indication that it could have been done (ICICI Bank signed the loan agreement
     to proceed after about 9 months of deliberations). The relevance of the Project improved slightly under
     the change of scope basis as loan utilization increased up to 73% and non-utilization reducing to 27%.
     The PCR rated the NHB loan as "partly relevant" and the ICICI loan as "relevant". On balance, IED
     rated both loans as "partly relevant". The Project made some headway in bringing about policy reforms
     and institutional strengthening as outlined earlier under items C (ii) above. These would facilitate
     greater availability of formal and informal resources for development of India's housing sector in the
     future.

     (ii) Effectiveness in Achieving Outcome: The PCR rated the NHB loan as "ineffective" (para. 75) and
     the ICICI Bank loan as "effective" (para. 76). As mentioned earlier, the entire Project as approved
                                                                                                        7


originally by the Board should have been taken into account in making this rating. The Project fell short
of meeting appraisal expectations in terms of both loan utilization status (only 29%) and assisting only
28,560 LIHs benefiting 143,000 persons or only about 10.5% of the 270,000 LIHs and 11% of the 1.3
million persons expected to directly benefit under the Project. Altogether, with recycling of loan
repayments 570,000 LIHs were expected to be assisted benefiting 2.7 persons. The component for
slum networking and home-work place subprojects and thereby contributing to poverty reduction did not
materialize with the HUDCO loan cancellation. Hence most of the outcomes and poverty reduction as
envisaged by the appraisal and outlined earlier under item B (iii) were not achieved. In these
circumstances, IED rated the Project as "less effective" in achieving its outcome. Loan utilization
improved under the reduced project scope (73%). As mentioned above, the PCR rated the NHB loan as
"ineffective" and the ICICI loan as "effective". On balance, even on the reduced project scope basis, the
Project is rated as only "less effective".

(iii) Efficiency in Achieving Outcome and Outputs: The PCR rated both NHB and ICICI Bank loans
as "less efficient" (paras. 77-78). There were delays in project implementation: the effectiveness of the
ICICI Bank loan was delayed by about 9 months and needed 4 extensions, and the terminal dates for
commitment were also delayed by about 16 months in the case of NHB loan and by about 6 months in
the case of ICICI Bank loan and both included one extension. The outcome and outputs were also not
achieved to the extent envisaged at appraisal due to low loan utilization status and insignificant number
of LIHs assisted as indicated earlier. The outcome and outputs were also not commensurate with the
level of resources in terms of effort, time, and funds expended on the Project by both Government and
ADB. Therefore, IED supported the PCR efficiency rating and rated the efficiency in achieving outcome
and outputs as "less efficient".

(iv) Preliminary Assessment of Sustainability: On the question of sustainability, the PCR rated the
NHB loan as "less likely" (para. 79) and the ICICI Bank loan as "likely" (para. 80). The sustainability of
the Project as approved by the Board should have been assessed not only these two loans. As much
as 71% of the total ADB loan of $300 million was canceled. As a consequence, only a small amount of
subloans/LIH subprojects were assisted i.e., a total of only 28,560 LIHs as against the 270,000 LIHs
envisaged at appraisal. The sustainability of ADB credit lines given in foreign exchange and to be
converted into rupee denominated loans under swap arrangements to assist LIHs became
questionable. This was indicated by the large loan cancellations due to the interest rate issue. Even
under the reduced project scope basis, NHB used only 18.5% of its loan mainly because of the interest
rate issue. There were also other issues in respect to sustainability: difficulties in accessing required
background information and income levels of LIHs to assess their credit risks and premium levels; some
subloan delinquency particularly those given by ICICI Bank for LIHs which raised the question of
affordability of market-based lending (PCR, para. 78) for LIHs; difficulties of lending through and NGOs
because of their high intermediation costs and capacity constraints; and problems of lending for slum
networking and home-work place subprojects. In the circumstances, IED rated the sustainability of the
Project as "less likely".

(v) Impact (both intended and unintended): The Project made only minimal impact on human
development. It assisted only 28,560 LIHs through subloans that benefited only 143,000 persons as
against the appraisal estimate of 270,000 LIHs or 1.3 million persons (or 570,000 LIHs benefiting 2.7
million persons with subloan repayment recycling). Also, the majority of these subloans were given
directly to LIHs (i.e., $68.35 million worth of subloans given by the ICICI Bank or 49% of the total
disbursements under the reduced project scope) which did not help to develop informal housing finance
institutions, especially CFIs and NGOs, to the extent expected by the appraisal. This also did not help to
develop linkages between formal and informal sectors to the extent envisaged by the appraisal. Sample
surveys showed that the assisted LIHs had improved their living conditions in terms of additional living
space, and better water, sanitation and health facilities under both NHB and ICICI Bank loans (PCR,
paras. 84-85). The progress made in the implementation of the policy and institutional reforms should
help to increase the availability of housing finance and to strengthen institutional capacity of HFIs in
both the formal and informal sectors, and facilitate housing investment in the future.

E. Overall Assessment, Lessons, and Recommendations

     (i) Overall Assessment: The PCR rated the NHB loan as "unsuccessful" (para. 82) and the ICICI
     Bank loan as "successful" (para. 82). The PCR should have made an assessment of the entire Project
     as approved by the Board and as outlined in the Project Framework and in accordance with the PCR
     preparation guidelines. IED's overall assessment of the Project was that it was "partly successful". This
     was based on the individual ratings: "less relevant," "partly effective" in achieving outcome, "less
     efficient" in achieving outcome and outputs, and sustainability as "less likely". As mentioned above, the
     PCR assessed the NHB loan as `"unsuccessful" and the ICICI loan as "successful". On balance, even
     under the reduced project scope basis, IED's overall assessment was that it was only "partly
     successful".

     (ii) Lessons: Three major lessons have been identified by IED: (i) projects, particularly those market-
     oriented, should have inbuilt flexibility or mechanisms to respond quickly to changing economic
     environments and to accommodate market volatility; (ii) early warning signals should be closely
     watched during project implementation to quickly reformulate project parameters to place the project
     back on track to meet project objectives as envisaged at appraisal; and (iii) need for ADB to address
     the question whether it was feasible to support market-based lending under credit lines in foreign
     exchange for relending in local currency loans using swap arrangements (swap arrangements were
     not freely available and were expensive) to meet housing needs of LIHs. Questions also arose in this
     regard on issues such as affordability, high intermediation costs, and difficulties of assessing risks.
     Perhaps, a more prudent approach could have been to address policy and institutional reforms through
     the program-based lending modality to strengthen institutions and policies to facilitate a greater
     availability of resources, and easier access thereto, on a sustainable basis, for meeting LIH housing
     requirements. The PCR also identified useful lessons (paras. 86­89), particularly on the need for
     products such as mortgage insurance and title insurance, and for improving land titles to increase
     lending to LIHs and help in delinquency management.

     (iii) Recommendations: In line with the lessons learnt, ADB needs to (a) exercise greater due
     diligence in the selection of institutions to act as conduits for its credit lines to ensure greater loan
     utilization and achievement of outcomes and impacts; (b) incorporate flexibility and mechanisms in
     project designs to enable re-orientation of project parameters during project implementation to
     respond to changes in the economic environment and to improve project's success prospects; and (c)
     continue policy dialogue with the Government backed up with appropriate forms of financial assistance
     and TA to keep strengthening the legal, regulatory, policy and institutional frameworks to facilitate
     greater availability of resources and easier access thereto, on a sustainable basis, to meet the housing
     needs of LIHs (ADB assistance could include TA to strengthen internal processing and supervision
     procedures and expertise of the informal sector [e.g., and NGOs], and to reduce their financial
     intermediation costs so that they could play more effective roles in meeting the housing needs of LIHs).
     The PCR also made useful recommendations (para. 90).

F. M&E Design, Implementation, and Utilization: The RRP included a Program Framework (Appendix
   1), and a Policy and Institutional Action Plan (Appendix 4). The RRP also included a Benefit Monitoring
   and Evaluation (BME) program to be undertaken by the Borrowers to ensure that the target
   beneficiaries realized the anticipated benefits under the Project. The Borrowers were to provide ADB
   with information produced under the BME program in the first quarterly report for each calendar year.
   ADB fielded 13 missions for 80 person-days in respect of the NHB loan and 9 missions for 117 person-
   days in respect of the ICICI Bank loan to monitor compliance with the Policy and Institutional Action
   Plan, BME performance, and to facilitate project implementation. These missions did well to ensure full
   loan utilization by the ICICI Bank but not as successful to ensure a greater loan utilization by NHB
   (utilization only 18.5% and cancellation 81.5%). Also, as pointed out earlier, perhaps, ADB could have
   played more proactive roles in reformulating the project based on changing economic environment to
   accommodate HDFC and HUDCO as they did in the case of the ICICI Bank to ensure greater
   utilization of the original loan and realize greater achievement of the outcomes and impacts as
                                                                                                            9


   envisaged at appraisal (footnote 1 of RRP). The BME did not appear to have provided the information
   ADB expected at appraisal, example, specific data on subloan repayment and bad debts status.

G. Other (e.g., safeguards, including governance and anticorruption; fiduciary aspects;
   Government assessment of the Project, as applicable): The PCR did not provide information on
   the procurement procedures followed in the disbursement of loan proceeds. Each of the Borrowers
   were to submit ADB: certified copies of its annual audited financial statements and the auditor's report
   within 9 months of the completion of the fiscal year; all accounts and statements of expenditures and
   revenues audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB; audited project accounts and report of the
   auditor within 9 months of the close of the financial year; and a completion report on loan utilization,
   subproject implementation, and performance of intermediaries and subborrowers not later than 3
   months after the loan closing date. These were received by ADB albeit with some delay as pointed out
   earlier. They helped to monitor project implementation.

                                                         was only 73% and cancellation 27%. Relevance

                                                         of the project on reduced scope basis became
                                                         questionable. Therefore, IED rated the Project on

Performance         Satisfactory        Less than        PCR emphasized regular review missions and
of ADB:                                 satisfactory     meetings to review performance of commitments
                                                         and disbursements and steps to improve
                                                         utilization. IED found flaws in design and

I.   Comments on PCR Quality: Its quality could have been enhanced had the following been done (i)
     assessment ratings (items D and E above) were made in accordance with PCR preparation guidelines
     which required assessment of the project as approved by the Board, not only parts of it that were
     proceeded with subsequently under change of project scope basis; (ii) provided more information on
     why ADB could not make the same implementation arrangements in respect to HUDCO and HDFC to
     enable their full loan utilization as done in the case of the ICICI Bank loan; (iii) quantified the actual
     contributions made by borrowers and beneficiaries toward project costs without which the actual total
     project cost at project completion could not be quantified; (iv) provided specific data on subloan
     repayment/bad debts status to judge their success prospects and sustainability and contributions
     made to outcomes and impacts; and (iv) procurement procedures applied for disbursement of loan
     proceeds (RRP, para. 52). However, in other areas the PCR was candid in reporting on design flaws in
     the appraisal and on the project performance at its completion.
