B. Project Description (summarized from the report and recommendation of the President [RRP])

   (i) Rationale

   While it is important for India to adopt a macroeconomic framework that enables it to sustain annual growth
   rates of around 7%, it is equally important to strive toward removing infrastructural (including power)
   deficiencies that present severe bottlenecks to the continued expansion of the economy. Given India's
   federal structure, all major issues affecting the power sector require concurrent action by the central
   government and state governments. As stated in the RRP, the project furthers the ongoing power sector
   reforms at the central level to: (a) improve governance, (b) build long-term institutional capacity, (c) improve
   efficiencies, and (d) facilitate private sector participation. In addition, to leverage power sector reform at the
   state level, the project is designed to differentiate between states undertaking sector reform and those that
   are not.

   Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) is the central agency responsible for the
   construction and operation of the main transmission network within India's five power regions (northern,
   northeastern, eastern, western and southern) as well as for interregional tie lines. POWERGRID therefore
   formulated a detailed, long-term transmission development plan that entailed an investment of about $5
   billion from FY2001 to FY2006 and included both interregional and intraregional transmission links. The
   rationale for this investment plan is the need to transmit, with adequate reliability and quality, the power
   produced from additional generating capacity programmed during the 5-year period; provide high-voltage
   transmission corridors to facilitate interregional power transfers; implement system strengthening schemes;
  2

  and form a national grid.

  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) agreed to finance a part of these requirements through the sector loan
  for power transmission improvement. The loan financed part of the foreign exchange cost of a group of
  transmission subprojects to be undertaken during a 5-year period beginning in 2000. The sector loan
  modality was adopted to provide flexibility in choosing subprojects that met the technical, financial,
  economic, environmental, and social criteria agreed upon by POWERGRID and ADB.

  (ii) Expected Impact

  The project, which was intended to improve transmission system performance, focused on subprojects that
  were (a) accorded high priority by the Government and POWERGRID, (b) an integral part of
  POWERGRID's transmission development plan, and (c) essential for the performance of the entire
  transmission system. The project was designed to encourage sector reforms at the state level. Thus, in
  selecting subprojects under the loan, the project differentiated between states that were undertaking sector
  reforms and those that were not. In particular, the project (a) accorded preference to improve transmission
  service in reforming or reformed state power sector entities, and (b) provided strong transmission networks
  to switch power supply from delinquent state power sector entities to those that had good payment records.
  It was expected that over time the project would also facilitate private sector participation, albeit indirectly, in
  the generation and distribution subsectors, by supporting subprojects that would help improve overall power
  system reliability and performance.

  (iii) Objectives or Expected Outcomes

  The stated objectives in the RRP are on two levels: technical and strategic. The technical objective was to
  strengthen POWERGRID's transmission systems so as to improve system reliability, reduce transmission
  losses, improve system quality, and enhance the efficient use of existing and planned generation plants.

  The strategic objectives were to: (a) support the restructuring of India's power sector; (b) enable private
  sector participation; (c) encourage the adoption of appropriate pricing mechanisms for all bulk supply of
  electricity; and (d) improve the commercial basis for all transmission transactions, thus ensuring
  POWERGRID's profitability, liquidity and ability to mobilize counterpart funds. ADB obtained assurances
  from the Government of India (Ministry of Power and Department of Economic Affairs) that necessary steps
  were being taken toward these objectives, although ADB did not offer direct support or advice.

  The project was also intended to help POWERGRID's transition from reliance on government-guaranteed
  programs and funds to funding through market-based programs, thus making POWERGRID more
  autonomous and commercially oriented.

  (iv) Components or Outputs

  As stated in the RRP, the project comprised two components that refer to two types of subprojects: (a) part
  A: upgrading and expanding 400 kilovolt (kV), 220 kV, and 132 kV transmission systems to transfer
  additional power, to improve system reliability, and enhance the efficient use of power plants; and (b) part
  B: installing 400 kV and 220 kV transmission systems to evacuate the power generated by central power
  utilities and independent power producers. Subsequently, it was noted that part B projects had included
  transmission systems at the 765 kV level as well.

C. Evaluation of Design and Implementation (project completion report [PCR] assessment and
   validation)

  (i) Relevance of Design and Formulation

  The relevance of project design and formulation may be gauged from the following facts and expectations:
     a. India's power requirements, power generating capacity and power production have been increasing
          rapidly from a capacity of 98,000 megawatts (MW) and an annual generation of about 481 billion
          kilowatt-hours (kWh) at the time of appraisal, to about 141,100 MW capacity as of January 2008
                                                                                                                     3

         and an annual generation of 710 billion kWh. Despite the rapid growth in generation of about 5.7%
         per annum, the country still experiences substantial peak power and energy shortages (estimated
         at 15% and 9% respectively).
      b. The power requirement is expected to continue to grow in the foreseeable future, possibly to about
         975 billion kWh by 2012, for which over 200,000 MW generating capacity would be required.
      c. Given that power shortages are being experienced owing to insufficient interregional and
         intraregional transmission links, 1 and that the energy resources are geographically unevenly
         distributed, the Government has placed a strong emphasis on the development of transmission
         corridors across the country, and set a goal of high-voltage interregional and interstate power
         exchanges of 37,000 MW by 2012 (up from 500 MW in 1995 and 5,000 MW in 2000).

Against this background, ADB's assistance to POWERGRID was designed to reinforce and expand the
transmission system as well as facilitate: (a) evacuation of power from new generating plants being
constructed or planned, (b) higher capacity use of existing generating capacity by making the interregional
power exchanges operational, and (c) an increase in the availability of power and an improvement in power
supply reliability in the southern and western regional grids.

POWERGRID prepared a long-term $5 billion transmission development plan and identified many
transmission subprojects. ADB actually supported only five subprojects that were high on POWERGRID's
priority list at the time of project implementation. Not all the selected subprojects were the same as those in
the candidate list or shortlist at the time of appraisal. The change in subprojects was due to decisions to (a)
defer three subprojects linked to the commissioning of three gas fired power plants, because of delays in
commissioning gas-based power generation capacity owing to a shortage of gas supplies; and (b) defer one
subproject linked to the commissioning of a hydroelectric project, which had suffered significant time
overruns (not unusual for hydroelectric projects in India). Against this background, the choice of a sector
loan modality is justified.

(ii) Project Outputs

In the original project design, the project had two components: (a) ADB financing of $250 million of the total
project cost of $491.5 million, and (b) ADB's partial credit guarantee (PCG) for commercial cofinancing of
$120 million. Only two of the five subprojects actually supported by the project were candidate or shortlisted
subprojects at appraisal.2 This should have been highlighted and discussed briefly in the PCR.

The PCR should also have highlighted two important facts. First, ADB was not actually required to extend
the PCG facility, because ABN AMRO was unable to raise commercial cofinancing for POWERGRID as
market conditions had changed, and a loan covenant gave POWERGRID the option not to make use of the
PCG facility if ADB could not help POWERGRID raise commercial cofinancing within six months of loan
approval. Second, despite this situation, ADB still managed to achieve the underlying objective of
increasing the commercial orientation of POWERGRID through continuous dialog and long-standing
support.

$250 Million Loan Component. ADB financing was meant for the two types of subprojects, which were
justified on the basis of load-flow analyses, evaluation of alternatives, financial and economic analyses, as
well as summary initial examination of environmental and social issues. The focus on these types of
subprojects remained consistent through the project cycle. However, the precise list of subprojects actually
supported changed significantly from that given in the RRP, which reflected changes in POWERGRID's
priorities and also justified the sector loan modality adopted for the Project. More specifically:
     a. the RRP of September 2000 listed nine candidate subprojects, comprising four subprojects in part
          A and five in part B. Five of these were to be supported by ADB (two in part A and three in part B).

1
    For instance, interregional links can improve the power situation in the western region by importing power from the
    eastern region. Likewise, the power supply situation in certain parts of most regions can be improved by high
    voltage transmission links within the region.
2
    Both the shortlist of subprojects for ADB support (five subprojects) and the list of candidate subprojects (nine
    subprojects, including the five in the shortlist) represented only a few of the transmission subprojects under
    consideration by POWERGRID as part of its $5 billion long-term transmission plan.
4

         However, the PCR stated that six of the nine candidate subprojects in the RRP were to be
         supported by ADB (the sixth being a part B subproject, to make it two in part A and four in part B).
      b. Three of the four part B subprojects were expansions of gas-fired power projects (Kawas-II,
         Gandhar-II and Anta-II) of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). It is understood that
         the expansion of all NTPC gas-fired power plants was delayed because of the unavailability of
         natural gas. As a result, the ADB project did not extend support to these three subprojects. The
         fourth part B subproject (Tala transmission system) was also dropped from ADB financing owing to
         delays in the implementation of the 1,020 MW Tala hydropower project in Bhutan.
      c. One part B subproject (Ramagundam-III Transmission System) and one part A subproject
         (Southern Regional Central Grid Reinforcement)3 were included for ADB financing as they moved
         up on POWERGRID's priority list and needed to be implemented urgently at the time (2000­2001).
      d. Finally, another part B subproject (Sipat Transmission System) was added to the list for ADB
         financing at the request of POWERGRID. Although it was generally expected that completion of the
         Sipat subproject would require the loan closing date to be extended by about 1 year, this subproject
         was accepted by ADB because it involved the setting-up of a technically advanced 765 kV
         transmission line for the first time in India.

ADB helped with POWERGRID's priorities as they changed during 2000 and 2001, and the project has:
   a. helped strengthen the transmission system and improve voltage levels and power quality in the
       southern and western regions through support of two subprojects (Southern Regional Central Grid
       Reinforcement, and Goa Grid Strengthening);
   b. facilitated interregional power transfers of 1,000 MW­1,400 MW through one subproject (the East-
       West Interregional Link);
   c. contributed significantly to evacuating 500 MW from a power plant through the Ramagundam-III
       Transmission System subproject;
   d. enhanced the power evacuation system from the Sipat power project by supporting transmission
       lines from the only 500 MW unit of the Sipat power project commissioned thus far. The
       implementation of the Sipat Transmission System subproject is timed to match the revised and
       delayed commissioning schedule for the units under the 2,980 MW Sipat power project, comprising
       two units of 500 MW each, plus three units of 660 MW each.

Commercial Cofinancing Support Component. During appraisal, the project also envisaged assistance
to POWERGRID to increase its commercial orientation by offering a PCG for $120 million cofinancing from
a commercial bank. Following an initial attempt to solicit commercial cofinancing when ABN AMRO was
selected and then backed out,4 POWERGRID informed ADB that they had raised a 15-year bond worth
Rs7615.2 million (i.e., more than $120 million) from the domestic market and would therefore not make use
of ADB's PCG facility.5

Although ADB did not extend its PCG facility, it is reasonable to infer that continued support from ADB has
contributed to an increased comfort level for POWERGRID in the market. It is noted that this sector loan is
the second loan to POWERGRID from ADB;6 and that in March 2008 ADB also approved a multitranche
financing facility to POWERGRID7 to extend loans of no less than $100 million to finance part of the costs of
some subprojects constituting its massive investment program.

3
    Although identified by POWERGRID as candidate subprojects at appraisal, these were not among the shortlist of
    subprojects considered for support at appraisal.
4
    ABN AMRO backed out because market conditions (around April 2001) were different from those at the time it had
    accepted the cofinancing mandate, which made it difficult for ABN AMRO to carry out the mandate.
5
    One of the stipulations of the Loan Agreement was that in the event that the cofinancing loan does not materialize
    within 6 months from the date of approval of the loan by ADB, POWERGRID shall raise the necessary funds on its
    own, to the satisfaction of ADB.

   million (actual, at the time of project completion), the entire ADB loan amount ($250 million) was disbursed.
   Funding from other sources, therefore, was less than originally envisaged ($140.9 million actually versus.
   $241.5 million as per appraisal estimate and $228.5 million as per revised estimate). However, this did not
   affect the project scope significantly.

   The progressive reduction in the total project cost was on account of the following:

       a. Revised estimate costs were lower than appraisal estimates, largely as a result of (a) a reduction in
          the total cost (excluding interest during construction [IDC] and front-end fee) of about $13 million,
          as seven of the nine subprojects were different when revised estimates were made; and (b) minor
          changes in the total IDC amount.
       b. Actual project costs were lower than the revised estimates, largely as a result of (a) a reduction in
          the total cost (excluding IDC and front-end fee) of $48.6 million, essentially reflecting a cost
          reduction of about $24 million each for two subprojects (the East­West Interregional Link; and Goa
          Grid Strengthening) as procurement costs were lower than initially estimated; and (b) a massive
          reduction of IDC by $41.4 million, which reflects good project management.

   Conformance to Schedule. At appraisal, it was estimated that all subprojects would be completed before
   the (original) loan closing date of 31 March 2006. All subprojects except for the Sipat transmission system
   were completed well before that date. It is noted that the Sipat Transmission System subproject was
   included even though it was clear that its inclusion would call for an extension of the loan closing date
   (estimated at the time to be about 1 year, i.e., to 31 March 2007). However, given the delays in the setting-
   up of certain units of the 2980 MW Sipat power plant, and to facilitate the completion of the subproject, the
   loan closing date was extended to 31 July 2007 at the request of POWRGRID. To enable the
   disbursements to be completed, the account was kept open until 10 August 2007.

   Disbursement. For four of the five subprojects, the contracts had been awarded by September 2002 (see
   the table below), and by 26 May 2003, it was clearly known that the actual project costs would be lower
   than previously estimated. However, the purpose of the May 2003 request for revisions was not to revise
        6

        the capital costs of the subprojects, but to reallocate the ADB loan proceeds (as requested by
        POWERGRID in April 2003) between various broad heads such as (i) costs project expenditures8 (ii) IDC,
        and (iii) front-end fee. In effect, $34.1 million was reallocated from the IDC category to the "Costs Project
        Expenditures" category. POWERGRID's justifications for seeking this reallocation from ADB, as given in the
        memo dated 26 May 2003, were based on the fact that: (i) POWERGRID gave an assurance that the
        remittance toward IDC costs would be made from its own resources and requested that the additional $34.1
        million be used toward financing eligible subprojects; and (ii) such a reallocation would not cause any
        change in the project scope.

        The entire amount was disbursed by August 2007. An ADB approved reimbursement procedure was used
        for disbursement purposes. The first disbursement under the loan was made on 8 March 2001 and the final
        disbursement on 10 August 2007 (the loan closing date), 77 months later. POWERGRID expressed
        satisfaction with ADB's disbursement procedures and informed the PCR mission that it had not experienced
        any disbursement problems.

        Borrower's Contribution. At appraisal, the project financing plan envisaged:
           a. an ADB loan of $250 million (from ordinary capital resources),
           b. commercial cofinancing of $120 million from the international market (supported by a PCG from
              ADB) and $16.3 million equivalent from the domestic market, and
           c. POWERGRID's internal resources of $105.2 million equivalent.

        As POWERGRID was able to raise commercial cofinancing from the domestic market on its own (to part-
        finance its own massive transmission system program that was several times larger than the project), the
        PCG was not used. Given the significant cost reductions owing to good project management and the ability
        to procure equipment and services at lower than expected costs, POWERGRID was in a position to meet its
        share of the obligations ($140.9 million equivalent) for investment in the five selected subprojects.

        It may be noted that although one of the justifications for seeking reallocation of the budget was that the
        additional loan amount that would be available after reallocation would be used to finance additional eligible
        projects, the fact remains that the ADB loan actually leveraged only another $140.9 million, (rather than
        $228 million as per revised estimates and $241 million as per appraisal estimates). This is because at the
        time of reallocation of the budget, the Sipat tenders had not yet been opened and it was expected that the
        reallocated $34.1 million could be used to finance additional projects. However, once the tenders for Sipat
        were opened, it became evident that almost the entire loan amount would be committed. This is why no
        additional subprojects were funded and the loan amount leveraged less capital than previously envisaged.

(iii)         Implementation Arrangements, Conditions and Covenants, Related Technical Assistance, and
              Procurement and Consultant Performance

Implementation arrangements were as envisaged at appraisal. Director (projects) of POWERGRID had the
responsible for construction supervision. POWERGRID's computerized integrated project management


        8
            The term "Costs Project Expenditures" is used in the ADB memo of 26 May 2003, which (in response to
            POWERGRID's request through a letter dated 24 April 2003) sought approval from ADB for the reallocation of the
            loan amount between various broad heads from the Country Director of ADB's India Resident Mission. The term
            "Costs Project Expenditures" covers both equipment supply, as well as erection and commissioning.
                                                                                                          7


overall responsibility for project implementation; and the regional executive directors of POWERGRID were
system made it possible to: (i) prepare a master schedule for each subproject, with work schedules for each
contract package with contractors; and (ii) regularly review and monitor progress on each subproject at field,
regional, and corporate levels. Subproject progress was monitored weekly and monthly at the regional level
by the respective regional executive director; and quarterly at the corporate level by POWERGRID's top
management, including the director (projects). The system enabled advanced planning and prevented
construction delays by providing adequate time for obtaining requisite forest clearances, acquiring land for
substations, and rehabilitating affected persons.

POWERGRID reported that the consultants performed the assigned tasks diligently and professionally, and
in accordance with their terms of reference. POWERGRID also reported that the performance of all
contractors was generally satisfactory; and that all goods and services procured for the Project complied
with the specifications and other operational performance standards. At completion, the Government and
POWERGRID had complied with all but one of the loan covenants. As per Schedule 4, para. 15 of Loan
Agreement, POWERGRID is to provide to ADB quarterly monitoring reports on the status of compensatory
forests for a period of 5 years after establishing each plantation (required where transmission towers are
erected). Although POWERGRID has made the necessary payments to the Forest Department to work on
the compensatory afforestation, and has been following up with the Forest Department, it is understood that
POWERGRID has not been able to obtain the requisite details regarding the compensatory forests. Thus, it
is not in a position to submit to ADB the covenanted quarterly monitoring reports.

A loan covenant that merits specific attention is Schedule 4, para. 21(b) of the Loan Agreement. This states
that the Government should grant autonomy to POWERGRID on investment decisions costing less than
Rs3 billion (subject to the statutory clearances, approvals and Government policies as applicable). By
conferring on POWERGRID the "Navratna Public Sector Enterprise" status on 1 May 2008, the Government
enabled POWERGRID to have the autonomy and flexibility to make investment and operational decisions
without any ceiling.

(v) Performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency

POWERGRID was the borrower and the Executing Agency. Its performance is gauged as follows:
  a. POWERGRID demonstrated its ability to formulate and appraise, arrange finance for, and carry out
     engineering, procurement and construction of a variety of projects in several parts of the country;
     and in doing so, it conformed to approved specifications and standards.
  b. With the exception of the Sipat Transmission System, all subprojects were completed well before
     the original planned completion dates. The delay in the Sipat Transmission System subproject was
     primarily due to delays in the implementation of NTPC's Sipat power project.
  c. Overall availability of POWERGRID's transmission system was 99.2% during 2006/07--which is
     comparable to the best transmission utilities in the world.
  d. POWERGRID was also successful in negotiating agreements on commercial terms with the
     beneficiary state electricity boards (SEBs) and other state utilities. For instance: (a) POWERGRID
     has a letter of credit that covers 101% of monthly billings; (ii) if the SEB or state utility delays
     payment beyond 60 days from the due date, then POWERGRID levies a surcharge of 1.25% (and if
     payment is still not made, the central Government pays POWERGRID from the state's plan
     allocation in the central Government's budget). This arrangement is working well, and there have
     been no defaults thus far.

The self-evaluation of POWERGRID's performance, rated as highly satisfactory, is thus confirmed.

(vi) Performance of the Asian Development Bank

ADB's performance may be gauged from the following:
   a. ADB monitored the Project's progress closely and regularly through quarterly progress reports; and
       provided advice in several areas, including procurement and project management. After project
       administration was delegated to the India Resident Mission in January 2003 (i.e., after all contracts
       had been awarded for four of the five subprojects), it closely monitored project administration and
       proposed timely corrective measures as necessary.
   8


       b. ADB gave timely approvals that enabled project milestones to be achieved.
       c. During the Project, ADB held several tripartite meetings with POWERGRID and the Government's
          Department of Economic Affairs, which helped in the successful implementation of the Project.
       d. ADB also held regular discussions and obtained assurances during the implementation phase (but
          offered little advice or guidance) that the Ministry of Power and POWERGRID were moving in the
          right direction toward achieving some of the strategic objectives. These objectives include
          implementing an availability-based tariff (ABT), establishing appropriate pricing mechanisms for
          bulk power transactions, improving the commercial basis for all transmission transactions, and
          creating an enabling environment to encourage private sector participation.
       e. It is noted that ADB could have made additional efforts to help achieve POWERGRID's compliance
          with the only loan covenant it did not comply with--that of providing quarterly progress reports on
          the status of compensatory forests--by contacting the Forest Department either jointly with
          POWERGRID or on its own.

   In view of the above, ADB's performance (rated as highly satisfactory) may be changed to satisfactory.

D. Evaluation of Performance (PCR assessment and IED's validation)

   (i) Relevance

   At the strategic level, the Project is in line with the Government's objective to improve power sector
   efficiency--including through improvements in the transmission infrastructure that facilitates: (a) export
   of power from regions with a surplus to ones with a deficit, as well as power evacuation to specific areas
   within a region where power supply quality and reliability is relatively low compared with the rest of the
   region; and (b) better use of existing, under-construction and planned power generating capacity.
   Furthermore, over the medium term, both these aspects also facilitate the achievement of economic
   growth objectives and other goals, such as increasing competition in the power sector through an
   "open access" policy articulated in the Electricity Act (2003). The "open access" policy in particular, also
   facilitates entry of more independent power producers and increases competition in power generation.
   Through a system of subproject selection that gave preference to states that either had already undertaken
   or were in the process of undertaking power sector reforms, the Project also encouraged state level
   reforms, which in turn facilitated private sector entry into generation and distribution.

   At project appraisal, ADB's strategy was to fund infrastructure projects in key sectors that contributed to
   economic growth. Its power sector strategy focused on: reinforcing and expanding the existing transmission
   system related to existing and new generation as well as formation of regional grids and a national grid;
   reforming state power sectors particularly through the restructuring and commercialization of SEBs and
   successor entities (where SEBs are unbundled); rationalizing bulk power tariffs; reforming the regulatory
   framework; and improving energy supply efficiency.

   At project completion, ADB's strategy for the Indian power sector was closely aligned with the Government
   of India's 11th five-year plan (2007­2012) objectives. ADB's current strategy includes the reinforcement of
   the power sector; promoting higher efficiency; expansion and optimization of transmission systems;
   promoting private sector participation; supporting institutional strengthening to implement the reforms
   required by the Electricity Act (2003); encouraging energy conservation; and ensuring environmental and
   social sustainability. The Project contributed to achieving these objectives.

   Against this background, the self-evaluation rating of highly relevant (to the power sector objectives of the
   Government and ADB's sector and country strategy) is confirmed.

   (ii) Effectiveness in Achieving Outcomes

   The Project achieved its immediate objectives of:
      a. upgrading and expanding the high-voltage transmission systems to increase power transmission
          capacity, improve system reliability, and enhance efficient utilization of power plants;
      b. facilitating export of power from the power-surplus eastern region to the power-deficit western
          region; and
                                                                                                           9

    c.   establishing adequate transmission systems to evacuate power generated by central power utilities
         to beneficiary states in the western and southern regions.

POWERGRID was able to implement the three part A subprojects ahead of schedule. The states that
benefited in the western and southern regions appreciated this achievement. POWERGRID achieved the
planned physical targets well within planned timelines, with the exception of the Sipat Transmission System.
However, this delay was for reasons beyond POWERGRID's reasonable control. Nevertheless, given that
NTPC had commissioned a 500 MW unit of the Sipat power station, and POWERGRID had provided the
requisite transmission capacity, coordination between the two power sector entities was clearly good.

When ABN AMRO decided not to raise the $120 million commercial cofinancing (albeit because of changed
market circumstances), it became difficult for ADB to assist POWERGRID in raising the required
cofinancing within 6 months of the loan approval date. POWERGRID was able to raise the requisite funds
from the Indian market, and ADB accepted the Government of India's request not to use the PCG facility.
Thus, the broad objective of facilitating POWERGRID's raising of non-sovereign guaranteed funds was
achieved. Against this background, the self-evaluation rating of effective is confirmed.

(iii) Efficiency in Achieving Outcome and Outputs

The Project has been implemented efficiently and all completed subprojects have been operating
continuously at almost full capacity from the date of commissioning. The economic internal rate of return
(EIRR) of the four subprojects at completion is also more than 20%.

                      Table 3: Subproject EIRR and FIRR at Project Completion
              Item                                         EIRR (%)        FIRR (%)
              East-West Interregional Link                   34.9            12.5
              Goa Grid Strengthening                         20.3             6.3
              Southern Regional Central Grid                 25.8             7.6
              Reinforcement
              Ramagundam III Transmission System             32.7             7.6

The EIRR of the Sipat Transmission subproject was not evaluated in the PCR as the power flow through
this subproject at project completion was only about 15% of the ultimate total--as only one 500 MW unit
had been commissioned versus total expected capacity of 2,980 MW. The remaining four units (1 of 500
MW and three of 660 MW each) are expected to be commissioned progressively until September 2009. As
the Sipat subproject accounts for more than 55% of the project cost, it is not possible to give a highly
efficient rating, despite the high EIRRs of the other subprojects. Against this background, the self-evaluation
rating of efficient is confirmed, subject to subsequent assessment of the Sipat Transmission System
subproject.

(iv) Preliminary Assessment of Sustainability

Technically, the design of all subprojects and the technology adopted are robust and appropriate, and in
line with the requirements of the Indian power sector and those for the project's long-term sustainability.
The technical standards and quality systems adopted, and the material and equipment procured and
installed are superior and unlikely to become obsolete during the useful economic life of the transmission
systems established under the project.

According to the Government's power sector projections, power shortages and constraints in the power
delivery system will continue and there will be adequate demand for evacuation of power from generating
stations as well as inter- and intra-regional power transfers, which will ensure the optimum use of the
transmission systems implemented under the project. Future funding for the required operation and
maintenance is not expected to be a problem, because the POWERGRID has in-house capability to
operate and maintain the subprojects effectively and efficiently.

Transmission tariffs are based on a cost-plus approach, which ensures the recovery of costs incurred at
10

normative levels (availability of 98% and a return on equity of 14% per annum). As availability is higher than
98% and the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for all subprojects is higher than the weighted average
cost of capital, the Project is financially viable and its returns will contribute to POWERGRID's overall
financial health. The Project is also expected to remain financially sustainable because: (a) POWERGRID
has executed commercial contracts with all beneficiaries; and (b) POWERGRID holds a letter of credit for
101% of monthly billing to the beneficiaries.

Other than the Sipat Transmission System subproject, for which the FIRR is not evaluated in the PCR, it is
noted that the FIRR of the other four subprojects is well above POWERGRID's weighted average cost of
capital of 5.35%. Against this background, the self-evaluation rating of likely to be sustainable is confirmed.

(v) Impact (both intended and unintended)

The PCR discussed the impacts of the Project, but did not provide a rating. The impacts discussed above
related to the increasing commercialization orientation of POWERGRID. Two other possible impact areas--
environmental and social--are assessed against the background that in 1998, POWERGRID became the first
Indian company to adopt environmental and social policy and procedures (ESPP) and that the ESPP is
broadly consistent with ADB's social and environmental policies.9

Environmental Impacts. POWERGRID took the following measures to minimize the Project's
environmental impact.
    a. Selected transmission line routes so as to avoid alignments through developed areas, human
       settlements, and cultural and historical places. In particular, the project impact on agricultural land
       was restricted to the construction phase. Where relevant, adequate compensation, as determined
       by the district authorities was paid to the affected persons.10 To minimize crop loss, where possible,
       the construction activities were carried out during the off-season.
    b. Minimized or altogether avoided damage to forests through, where possible avoiding forest areas or
       else routing through forest areas in consultation with the divisional forest officers. The specific
       concerns addressed with the forest officers were: (i) line routes should avoid wetlands and unstable
       areas, and (ii) line routing should have no or bare minimum impact on wildlife. Furthermore, lopping
       of trees to maintain line clearances was done under the direction of the Forest Department, and
       compensatory afforestation was provided for in accordance with the laws of the Government of
       India.
    c. Made efforts to create robust institutional arrangements for monitoring of environmental mitigation
       measures. For instance, POWERGRID established a full-fledged Environment Management
       Department (EMD) at its corporate office; the regional headquarters were responsible for
       monitoring the implementation of the environmental impact mitigation and rehabilitation measures
       for the subprojects and reporting to the EMD.11

POWERGRID also ensured that: (a) Transformers and other equipment used in the Project were free from
polychlorinated biphenyl;12 and (b) Used batteries and transformer oil were disposed off in accordance with
the provisions of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. Compliance with these provisions was reported
to the Ministry of Environment and Forests through biannual reports.

Social Impacts. The project is gender-neutral with regard to beneficiaries, as all categories of electricity
consumers--residential, agricultural, industrial, commercial, etc.--derive benefits from the project. The
benefits include increased power availability and better supply reliability, particularly in the western and


9
   The ESPP includes a framework for identification, assessment and management of environmental and social
   concerns at the corporate and project levels.
10
   Powergrid paid $2.88 million equivalent for loss of crops during construction and losses because of damage to
   trees.
11
   Powergrid also instituted a corporate policy in 2001 for construction of rain harvesting tanks at all new substations.
   The rain harvesting tanks help to increase the ground water level in the surrounding areas.
12
   Polychlorinated biphenyls are very stable compounds that readily penetrate skin, PVC, and latex (natural rubbers).
   They do not degrade easily, and can be destroyed through thermal or catalytic processes (thereby running the risk
   of creating substances that are even more toxic).
                                                                                                                     11

   southern regions.

   Measures taken by POWERGRID to address the concerns of the project-affected persons (PAPs), including
   rehabilitation assistance, are considered satisfactory. Some PAPs gained employment during the
   subprojects' construction stages, and in some cases, PAPs and local residents were also employed through
   local contractors after subproject completion.13

   In general, the project is expected to have a positive impact towards poverty alleviation and inclusive growth
   objectives, by enabling: (a) increased investments in the beneficiary states of the western and southern
   regions; (b) creation of long-lasting and stable, direct and indirect employment opportunities; and (c)
   enhancement of skills during implementation of the various subprojects, thus increasing future employment
   potential. This validation rates impact as moderate.

E. Overall Assessment, Lessons, and Recommendations (validation of PCR assessment)

   (i) Overall Assessment

   The project is rated successful on the basis of the four evaluation criteria--relevance, effectiveness,
   efficiency, and sustainability--of the Independent Evaluation Department. The strategic importance of
   strengthening and expanding the transmission system is high, and is supported by the Government.
   POWERGRID formulated a detailed, long-term transmission development plan that entailed an investment
   of $5 billion during FY2001 through FY2006. In addition, the Government has set a goal of increasing high-
   voltage interregional and interstate power exchanges from 5,000 MW in 2000 to 37,000 MW by 2012.

   The project supported selected subprojects, and POWERGRID was successful in implementing them
   ahead of schedule, with the exception of the Sipat Transmission System subproject, which was delayed for
   reasons beyond the reasonable control of POWERGRID. The Project's success in terms of making it
   sustainable is also evident from the fact that POWERGRID entered into commercial contracts with the
   SEBs and power utilities, and that ADB's constant dialog with the Government was instrumental in the
   implementation of ABT that has helped to improve noticeably the quality of power supply.

   Although the entire ADB loan amount ($250 million) was spent, it leveraged less capital than envisaged at
   the time of appraisal, or even when revised estimates were made in July 2003. With the set of subprojects
   finally supported through the Project (following several changes, only two of the five subprojects actually
   supported were in the shortlist for support at appraisal) the total project cost was about $87.5 million less
   than the revised estimates. No doubt this cost reduction reflected POWERGRID's good project
   management skills and its ability to procure equipment and services at costs substantially lower than initially
   envisaged (which were largely quantifiable by July 2003 when revised estimates were made). However, it is
   not unreasonable to consider that the savings provided an opportunity for ADB to identify one (or perhaps
   two) additional suitable subprojects for support (subject of course, to their meeting all relevant technical,
   economic, financial, environmental, and social criteria) from the large shelf of transmission system
   subprojects identified by POWERGRID.

   (ii) Lessons

          a. The change in the set of subprojects actually supported (versus the candidate subprojects or those
             short-listed for support at appraisal) indicates the need for a thorough due diligence on the
             likelihood of the need for a particular transmission subproject during the intended project timeline--
             especially when it is linked to the coming onstream of additional power generating capacity. In this
             specific context, due consideration should have been given to (i) the situation with regard to natural
             gas availability in 2000 (as three subprojects were clearly linked to the expansion of existing gas

        For instance, as part of the Goa Grid Strengthening subproject, no persons were displaced as a consequence of
        the acquisition of government-owned land. In addition: (i) besides providing employment to local residents during
        the construction of substations and the transmission line, POWERGRID also employed 57 persons full-time
        (through contractors) as semi-skilled and unskilled wage earners; and (ii) in keeping with corporate social
        responsibility requirements, POWERGRID constructed a culvert across the Ker river to improve the connectivity
        between Ker village and other parts of Goa.

           fired power plants), and (ii) realistic project timelines for large hydroelectric projects in India.
        b. Nonetheless, the flexibility required to change the list of subprojects for support, which was
           accorded by the sector loan approach, indicates that the sector modality was appropriate.
        c. Proper planning (and where needed, advance action), effective project monitoring, and motivated
           and well-trained personnel make possible the timely and successful implementation of power
           transmission projects.
        d. Regular ongoing interaction with the Government is necessary to ensure that the broader strategic
           aspects (such as regulatory issues, commercialization, etc.) are in place to make infrastructure
           projects successful.

   (iii) Recommendations

   To document the financial and economic viability of the Sipat Transmission System subproject when it is
   fully commissioned and the requisite data become available.

F. Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization (PCR assessment and validation)

   The monitoring and evaluation design framework focused largely on tracking the implementation of the
   various subprojects. POWERGRID has used a sophisticated framework for project management purposes,
   which is described very briefly in the PCR. The PCR does not provide any evidence of using a rigorous or a
   suitably structured socioeconomic impact assessment framework; nor does it develop indicators on direct
   effects (project outcome and outputs) and indirect effects (welfare outcome) of the Project.

G. Other (e.g., safeguards, including governance and anticorruption; fiduciary aspects; government
   assessment of the Project, as applicable) (PCR assessment and validation)

   Since 1998, POWERGRID has adopted certain environmental and social policies and procedures that are
   broadly consistent with ADB's social and environmental policies. Consequently, POWERGRID is reported to
   have managed the social and environmental safeguards well.

I. Comments on PCR Quality

   (i) Inconsistencies should be removed (eg. as per para. 39 of the PCR the project was rated "highly
         relevant" both at appraisal and completion; while para. 40 states that the Project was rated "relevant").
   (ii) The PCR should have pointed out certain aspects, for instance:
             (a) Only two of five subprojects actually supported were in the shortlist for support at appraisal.
                 Nonavailability of natural gas was a key determinant for dropping three subprojects previously
                 shortlisted; and significant implementation delays (not unusual in India and other south Asian
                 nations) was the reason for dropping another subproject previously shortlisted for support.
             (b) Although the PCG was not extended, the underlying objective of increasing the commercial
                 orientation of POWERGRID was still achieved.
             (c) The strategic objectives were accomplished, but ADB's contribution was minimal (if any). ADB
                 focused on obtaining assurances that things were moving in the right direction.
   (iii) The PCR should have included a socioeconomic impact assessment with an appropriate framework.
   (iv) The economic and financial analyses of the Sipat subproject could have been attempted with
         reasonable assumptions on cost and revenue stream with the likely commissioning date of September
         2009
   (v) The PCR could have assessed overall performance at two levels: (a) strategic (commercialization of
         POWERGRID, ABT, supporting reforms of SEBs); and (b) subproject selection and implementation.
