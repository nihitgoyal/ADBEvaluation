A. Project Description

   1.     Project Background

   In December 2003, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved funding of up to $40 million equivalent in
   Indian rupees sourced through a local currency bond issue for the Private Sector Housing Finance Project
   in India. The purpose was to promote market-based mortgage lending to underserved markets in the
   country. ADB intended to extend corporate loans of $20 million each, to support the expansion of two
   rapidly growing, well-capitalized and profitable housing finance companies (HFCs), Sundaram Home
   Finance Limited and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL). After ADB Board approval,
   however, the loan to Sundaram was not disbursed. The project thus entailed the provision of a 10-year loan
                                                            1
   to DHFL for the purpose of originating new housing loans. The loan agreement signed by DHFL and ADB
   on 19 July 2004 provided for the extension of long-term, fixed-rate rupee debt to limit interest rate and
   maturity mismatches, and avoid currency risk. After the loan agreement was signed, ADB, at DHFL's
   request, amended the loan agreement to allow DHFL to draw both fixed and floating rate disbursements
   from ADB in line with changing market conditions.

   ADB's loan to DHFL in the amount of Rs918.6 million was fully disbursed from November 2004 to June
   2005. Currently, DHFL is the third largest HFC and the second largest private sector HFC in India. Although
   its overall share of India's mortgage finance market is growing, it is still small, at about 1.5%. In 2003, DHFL
   had 41 branches. At the time the XARR was prepared, DHFL had 155 locations: 53 main branches, 67
   service centers, and 35 other outlets across the country. DHFL has been targeting the low- and middle-
   income (LMI) segment in semi-urban and rural areas and has steadily increased its disbursements to this
   segment. It has effectively structured and diversified its products to respond to the rapidly changing
   macroeconomic scenario without changing its customer focus and long-term lending strategy. The weighted
   average term of the portfolio was 13.36 years as of 31 March 2007, with the average loan size showing
   DHFL's commitment to the LMI segment.


B. Issues, Lessons, and Recommendations (Validation of XARR Assessment)

   1.     Issues and Lessons

   The extended annual review report (XARR) identifies the following issues for further monitoring: (i) the
   impact of any aggressive expansion by commercial as well as public banks into the LMI segment on
   DHFL's financial position; and (ii) DHFL's access to long-term financing to avoid maturity mismatches. This
   validation agrees that those issues need further monitoring. In addition, this validation recommends that the
   Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) closely monitor DHFL's continued compliance with ADB's
   financial covenants.

   The XARR highlights the following lessons from the project: (i) mortgage finance for customers in the LMI
   segment can be commercially viable, but HFCs or commercial banks must have highly trained and
   experienced staff, and sound credit underwriting and portfolio management policies to successfully
   generate business in this market segment; and (ii) reliance on a government regulator, such as National
   Housing Bank (NHB), as a major source of funding may not be sustainable over the long term, considering
   that financing is not its primary function and there is an inherent conflict of interest between the financing
   and oversight functions. This validation agrees with these lessons.

  2.   Recommendations

  The XARR recommends the inclusion of mortgage industry prudential standardssuch as limits on a
  borrower's ability to offer loans on a high loan-to-value basisas financial covenants for ADB financial
  intermediation loans for housing finance. This validation agrees with this recommendation.
