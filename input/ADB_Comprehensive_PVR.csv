Basic Education Sector Development Program: Validation of Completion Report,This report validates the completion report's assessment of the program. IED overall assessment: Successful.,http://wcm.adb.org/documents/lao-people-s-democratic-republic-basic-education-sector-development-program,24-12-15,,Lao PDR,,Validation of Project/Program Completion Report,,PVR Successful/Generally successful,,,,,PVR-443,"Three important lessons were identified in the PCR (program completion report) and this validation acknowledges them as important. In particular, taking a sector-wide approach to sector development with implementation support that is closely linked to and complements policy reform is important. It is clearly essential to ensure that there is close alignment of the content of the RRP (report and recommendation of the President) and the explicit outcomes and outputs in the DMF (design and monitoring framework). This validation notes that there were a number of inconsistencies in the RRP.
project cycle stage: Concept, Implementation

There was clearly strong coordination and strategic dialogue among all stakeholders in this program. This appears to have been a strong feature of the BESDP (Basic Education Sector Development Program) implementation effort with the executing agency, consultants, and ADB freely interacting and discussing issues that allowed some recovery from initial delays.
project cycle stage: Implementation

There was value gained by engaging MOES (Ministry of Education and Sports) units as implementing partners to help build institutional capacity and ensure sustainability at post-project. This is often discussed in the design of development aid programs but is rarely evident in the final implementation. In this program, the careful identification of responsibilities and division of labor, clear unit and individual accountability, and sustained monitoring were critical to its success.
project cycle stage: Design, Implementation, Operation

It is essential that the DMF (design and monitoring framework) in the RRP (report and recommendation of the President) accurately presents the outcomes, outputs, and indicators that will be used to evaluate the performance of the program. Monitoring systems should be specified in the RRP and established at implementation and that responsible staff are identified at central and local levels for monitoring key activities.

The criteria for the qualification of contractors under a joint venture and for the award of multiple contracts should be strengthened. The PCR did not elaborate how this can be accomplished. This needs to be further assessed to formulate concrete steps to ensure that prequalified contractors are indeed capable as claimed and have the technical and financial resources to complete the proposed project. While performance bond requirements seek to guarantee contractor performance, this seemed ineffective under this project. There is also a need to strengthen provisions related to contractors' performance, such as mobilization, staffing, deployment of equipment and funds, release of payments, bonus for early completion, and penalties so that poor contractor performance could be discouraged. Likewise, the performance of the contractor should be assessed at the initial stages of the contract and the decision on termination, if warranted, should not be delayed.

First, implementation of institutional reforms is more effective and efficient when there is a detailed blueprint with measurable indicators, and implementation arrangements are in place. Second, to attract investments, Kyrgyz Republic firms should also strengthen their productive capabilities and improve their competitiveness. Third, the significant changes in the methodology of the 2015 Doing Business report have negatively affected the Kyrgyz Republic's overall position in the ranking, making it difficult to measure achievements against the program's initial target. However, this validation notes that the Global Competitiveness Report can provide a good alternative source of information on the country's overall competitiveness. And last, the PCR indicated that the report's usefulness lies more in monitoring the country's performance over time rather than measuring progress against other economies. This validation adds the lesson that extensive dialogue is needed, particularly for reforms that meet resistance, to facilitate better cooperation and implementation.

The first lesson was the need for realistic cost estimates. To avoid loan cancellations, effective due diligence should be undertaken through detailed engineering studies, examination of market rates of construction materials and consultant remuneration, and inclusion of careful calculations of physical and price contingencies in the project cost estimate. The second was the need for clearly identifying the role of the project management consultant. The original terms of reference did not properly define the tasks and deliverables of each expert and considerable time for refinements was needed. The third was the need to improve the executing agency's project management capacity. Inadequate knowledge and expertise of MOTC (Ministry of Transport and Communications) and the Committee for Roads on safeguards and procurement affected smooth project implementation. This validation supports these lessons. In addition, the validation notes traffic forecasts should be much more realistic, and reflect impacts of follow on projects on expected usage. Similarly, more effort should be taken to establish sustainable asset management systems, supported by credible sources of funding.

While all of these are appropriate, this validation highlights mainly two of these as they have wide applicability across developing countries and within ADB. The first lesson deals with the reinforced conviction that WUA (water users association) and/or WUAF (water users associations' federation)-guided participatory irrigation management can be successfully implemented at the district level and in the lower levels in developing countries. The participation of farmers in these schemes improved project implementation as compared to the situation when there was exclusive reliance on administrators and contractors. The second lesson relates to the need to avoid overwrought arrangement for project disbursements. In this project, prorated financing arrangements from three different fund sources across each category of expenditure constrained the flow of funds. The size of imprest accounts should also be large enough to provide adequate cash flow for the executing agencies to operate while disbursement applications are being processed. This is particularly applicable for sector projects.

A more effective, high-level coordinating body needs to be established for a complex project of this nature, which comprised various groups of outputs. This could help regularly monitor a project's implementation progress. Planning and coordinating preliminary activities must be done well to minimize delays, including the use of advance actions. Sufficient consultation during project preparation should be undertaken in light of the CHC's (Customs House of Chittagong) decision during implementation not to use ADB funds for their automation program.
project cycle stage: Implementation

This validation offers a few lessons. During project implementation, constant follow-up is needed on the operationalization of the PPMS (project performance management system) and the conduct of baseline and other survey/data collection requirements that could be used in the PCR's (project completion report's) preparation. Likewise, the membership in the project coordination committee could have included a representative of the CCC (Chittagong City Corporation).

project cycle stage: Implementation

The PSC (project steering committee) provided prompt policy guidance and expedited decisions and actions. The needs of the countries were ascertained and their access to project resources was adequate.
project cycle stage: Implementation

The project's One Health concept emphasized the links between animal health and human health, and emerging animal and human diseases, which allowed a platform for unprecedented integration of animal, human, and ecosystem health issues to fight the threat of avian influenza. The systematic collaboration of technical agencies across disciplines, such as the FAO or Food and Agriculture Organization (veterinarians) and WHO or World Health Organization (medical doctors) and civil society organizations (community health workers), promoted this concept since the beginning of the project. ADB's financial and convening power and its high flexibility and responsiveness under the project helped build links and strengthen collaboration between WHO, the FAO, and the World Organization for Animal Health.
project cycle stage: Implementation

The urgent nature of the project due to the threat that avian influenza may become a pandemic, hampered the attempt in defining verifiable indicators for some outputs under the regional capacity building and regional coordination components. A project midterm review would have helped to review and update the DMF (design and monitoring framework).
project cycle stage: Design

This type of project faces the challenge of the early spread of the disease outpacing the gathering of scientific evidence essential in formulating containment policies. In the early days of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, the avian influenza, and the H1N1 pandemic, uncertainty stalled decision making, including the decisions on the timing of changing policy from containment to mitigation.

This validation adds another lesson related to the relevance of design and formulation. Assessment of relevance includes both the relevance of objectives and the relevance of design. The adequacy and appropriateness of project design have to be tailored to the project's ultimate objectives and complexities.

The PCR also indicated the need to have careful estimation of the costs of construction materials and more realistic traffic forecast.
project cycle stage: Feasibility, Implementation

This validation offers three additional lessons. First, before implementing any additional works or contract variation, there should already be agreement on the works to be done and the commensurate costs. While this is an accepted project management practice, it may not have been the case in this project, which resulted in significant delays in loan closing due to the negotiations on pricing for additional works or variations. Second, while work on the land acquisition and resettlement seemed to have progressed well, the executing agency - the WYRC (West Yunnan Railway Company) - should have been provided more assistance in its implementation given its inexperience with both PRC (People's Republic of China) and ADB practices. As such, ADB assistance, through more frequent missions during the implementation period, could have provided the guidance needed for land acquisition and resettlement. A third lesson was the need to constantly follow-up with the executing agency on the implementation of the PPMS (project performance and monitoring system). It is surprising to note that this loan condition was not readily achieved, although its compliance was considered as ongoing.

This is mainly from a political economy perspective. Any long-term structural adjustments would need sustained negotiations with the government and the support of all the major development partners. This validation concurs with this finding.
project cycle stage: Implementation

On subproject selection, the PCR highlighted that the systematic subproject selection process indeed worked and led to funding of better ventures. (Subproject selection process introduced by the project involved the following: (i) the Fujian project management office [PMO] trained implementing agencies in subproject selection and the latter disseminated subproject opportunities and requirements to the public; (ii) implementing agencies called for proposals from enterprises; (iii) county PMOs and financial bureaus screened candidate subprojects (based mainly upon financial viability and sustainability for enterprise subprojects, and local development plans and priorities for infrastructure subprojects); (iv) prefecture PMOs and financial bureaus recommended candidate subprojects (considering borrowing capacity, priority industry and area of prefecture); and (v) the Fujian PMO and the Fujian Finance Department [FFD] assessed the proposed subprojects and selected the most feasible ones on behalf of the FPG.

On partnership with the private sector, the project experience confirmed that private enterprise involvement was important in branding and marketing of farm products, in introducing quality standards and technology, in improving farm infrastructure, and in providing extension services. On the design of project components, one should be realistic in the number of components covered, as reducing it to a manageable size would have facilitated project management. This validation is of the view that the latter is the main lesson from this project. The eight components - spanning agriculture improvement, natural resource conservation, hydropower, and credit - were not conducive for (i) a high quality project design, (ii) relatively short ADB processing missions, and (iii) effective implementation by one PMO. These resulted in various technical problems under the project.

There is a need for careful analysis of properties of collapsible loess at project sites since various types of collapsible loess behave differently and some treatment methods are more effective than others. (Collapsible loess is characterized by low density and cohesion, appreciable strength, and stiffness in the dry state, but is susceptible to significant deformation as a result of wetting. The approach used is applicable in project areas that are temperate and arid with annual average precipitation of about 300 millimeters. The main function of the upper layer asphalt is to provide water penetration to earthwork and skid resistance.) Also, for projects that encounter collapsible loess, sufficient budget should be allocated to the design of foundation treatment and its construction, which is more economical than having to remedy later deformed roads caused by inappropriately treated loess. Pavement layers should be constructed, to the extent possible, after 1 year or more after the settlement of earthworks, depending on the type of treatment of collapsible loess. This validation finds these lessons appropriate.

Given the significant increase in the number of affected households and the realignment of part of project construction sites, this validation would like to add a lesson on project cost estimation.

The first three of these - simple program scope, achievable tranche conditions, and realistic time frame - should have been better taken into account in the design. For example, the requirement for Parliament to adopt the regulatory framework for banking supervision as a condition for tranche release was a risk to the program's success. Legislative changes require wider consensus building for change, capacity building, and work with policy makers and legislators. The PCR also suggested that when supporting a reform program to introduce new and unfamiliar initiatives/concepts, consultants may need to spend even more time in countries with limited capacities.

In assessing the effectiveness of the program and ADB's performance in implementing it, this validation notes that greater care should be taken in defining the program's outcome deliverables.

Viet Nam: Upper Secondary Education Development Project,,http://www.adb.org/documents/viet-nam-upper-secondary-education-development-project,28-11-14,,Viet Nam,,Validation of Project/Program Completion Report,,PVR Successful/Generally successful,,,,,,"This validation generally agrees with the lessons detailed in the project completion report (PCR). Some are well known from the past experiences of ADB. One of these is the need for the project manager to be appointed early to assist with the detailed design of project. The size of the consultant services package should correspond to the size and complexity of the work required in a project, otherwise, the project implementing unit will not be able to cope nor will it gain as much capacity development as was intended. In this project, there were areas where a lack of expertise within various PPIUs, especially in financial reporting and information technology, caused difficulties. Similarly, more attention to the pre-project training of project staff may prove to be a worthwhile initial investment of time and funds.

Engaging local communities in school-improvement activities allowed for much better linkages with local contexts. Likewise, the flexibility of the new curricula's component that took account of the regional and/or local context, particularly for ethnic groups, was important. Involving local communities in managing civil works may also be extended to other areas of school operations. For example, having teacher and school management training to occur within local schools could result in engaging high-performing leaders and local managers as trainers. This strategy is being used successfully in other countries with consultant input being brought in to work with local practitioners.

The development of an education management information system has significantly improved planning as program effectiveness and efficiency can be monitored and more strategic decisions can be made in allocating resources according to identified needs. In addition, the research-based pilot studies on school management and decentralization yielded good preliminary insights on how to effectively apply the principles of school-based management of upper secondary education (USE) at the local level. Other project pilot studies such as school mapping were not as successful, but it seems that pilot studies are a worthwhile project subcomponent as they map a path for introducing innovations and for building capacity within local agencies to undertake meaningful applied research.

The PCR also identified a lesson that suggested project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultants to coordinate closely with the government agencies to ensure compatibility of project design with the sector strategy of the government.

Philippines: Financial Market Regulation and Intermediation Program,,http://www.adb.org/documents/philippines-financial-market-regulation-and-intermediation-program,25-11-14,,Philippines,,Validation of Project/Program Completion Report,,PVR Partly/less than successful,,,,,,"One of the lessons drawn by the project completion report (PCR) is that programs and technical assistance (TA) work should not depend on the passage of law in countries where legislative processes are slow and cumbersome. On the other hand, ADB backing and support may be crucial for authorities to be able to push for reforms in difficult political environments, such as the Philippines. This should be weighed more carefully in undertaking critical reform programs, although attention should be paid for improving the process.

The second lesson noted by the PCR is the need to undertake a deeper and broader analysis of the political economy for ADB to better gauge the prospect of reforms within the program time frame. The PCR also noted, for example, that the Capital Market Development Plan (CMDP) was initiated unilaterally by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, clearly, it was not reflective of industry sentiment, hence, it did not enjoy widespread support. In the case of the Insurance Commission, pressure from the industry to postpone higher required capitalization contributed to a change in the Insurance Commissioner and a reduction in political will in support of reform. Reforms clearly require consensus building and consistent support. Moreover, in countries such as the Philippines, one needs to have an influential and bold champion behind reforms.

The third lesson learned is program design should focus on implementing reforms not only where commitment is strong but also where resources and external factors are adequate to ensure successful implementation. A program administration memorandum that defines actions, timelines, and costs, especially for complex, complicated reform programs may be useful.

Parallel reforms in related areas are also critical components to ensure the success of sector reform programs, particularly where reforms may depend on reforms in other sectors (such as governance and fiscal management) or cut across sectors.",Philippines: Financial Market Regulation and Intermediation Program,38276-013,"ADB is helping the Philippines develop a more efficient financial sector.

First, complex and multi-activity projects such as this are better done in adjoining areas (e.g., provinces) to ensure implementation efficiency and more uniformity of issues being addressed. Second, continuing stakeholder training is important to implementation success. Third, there is a need to pay closer attention to accurate cost estimates and provisioning for price inflation in Viet Nam. Work delays under the project were associated with price increases and compounded by unfamiliarity with procurement regulations of both ADB and the government. Fourth, more attention is needed to monitoring outcomes. Given ADB's results-based approach to project management, outcome monitoring would have been a priority. Fifth, future projects should consider investment size that takes into account the limited capacity of the central and local governments to cover required recurrent expenditures and the need of the projects to use appropriate technology with manageable cost implications.

In this project, it becomes clear that the most successful elements of the project were those that could feed into the government plan at early project preparation phase, so these could be incorporated into the government development plan. The project steering committee (PSC) effectively acted as an interagency working committee, and further validates the lesson that such a committee should be established early before project start-up. Other lessons identified, however, were not particularly insightful, such as the call for a realistic setting of performance targets, and the need for a strong political support to sustain improvement in nature reserves.

On the resettlement aspect, this validation concurs with the lessons highlighted in the PCR, where successful resettlement was realized due to good planning, government support, extensive consultation with affected communities, and close supervision. The project was able to transform the livelihood of the affected people from activities that caused environmental degradation to those that support nature conservation, through greater income reliance on non-timber forest products (NTFPs), use of intensive farming practices to reduce water use, and availability of ecotourism as a source of income. The experience showed that resettlement can be done properly without serious conflicts, as long as beneficiaries are involved in all stages of planning and implementation. Changing of livelihoods, which is usually considered as difficult particularly from farm to nonfarm (ecotourism), were properly implemented in this project, while maintaining or even increasing income levels. The PCR highlighted three key lessons in which this validation concurs: (i) the policy support lasts longer than one-time cash compensation; (ii)thecombination of proper restoration sites and the proper development of alternative livelihoods can ensure watershed and wetland protection, while maintaining livelihoods and incomes; and (iii) non-cash compensation for eco-resettlement sometimes achieve better results than cash compensation.","China, People's Republic of: Sanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection",35289-013,"The Sanjiang Plain comprises 108,900 square kilometers, where the Heilongjiang, Songhua, and Wusuli rivers are confluent in a vast alluvial floodplain in the northeast of Heilongjiang Province.

Each proposed program is to link itself to a single, consolidated government-led policy matrix. This approach will enhance coordination and collaboration and government ownership. Another critical lesson unique to Tonga is to have the exact method for ADB verification of each tranche and/or policy action to be discussed and agreed upon beforehand with the government.

The PCR also listed other lessons that are generally applicable to future programs, such as (i) policy actions need to match capacity; (Reflecting on the program design, the PCR reported that some ADB development partners considered that a tougher stance should have been taken to promote deeper structural reforms (e.g., reduce civil service redundancies) as first tranche policy actions. Some of the adopted actions (e.g., achieving financial ratios) were considered too easy to implement. This illustrates the challenge one would have in balancing reform ambitions with institutional capacity and political will on the ground.) and (ii) provision of a technical assistance (TA) that can effectively aid program implementation. Based on the program's lack of success in tracking its impact on the health and education services standards, this validation recommends that future programs should exercise closer scrutiny to ensure that outcome indicators are available and accessible. Generally, for reform actions meant to assist or to protect vulnerable groups, a deeper analysis on the program design needs to be undertaken, rather than focus on maintaining or enlarging certain budgetary allocations. After program completion, the PCR recommended that a continuing monitoring be done by ADB through its various missions to Tonga to ensure sustained benefits of the policy actions.

Firstly, the manager selection process was not documented in either the report and recommendation of the president (RRP) or the XARR. Although several qualified firms had been interviewed beginning at the time of the concept clearance paper, the winning manager (Mekong Capital Limited or MCL) was created during the year between concept clearance and RRP approval by a departing employee from one of the major firms interviewed, in a process contrary to representations in the concept clearance paper (CCP) - which stipulated that the fund manager selection must be transparent - and was not described in the RRP, XARR, or other documents available to this validation.

Secondly, the fund deviated from its main objective of investing in private sector small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as stated in the RRP and the investment management agreement. SMEs were not defined in the RRP and the investment management agreement but at least 4 of the 10 investee companies of Mekong Enterprise Fund (MEF) were not SMEs as defined by the Government of Viet Nam. ADB was on the Board of MEF and the fund manager has been providing regular reports to ADB so ADB should have been able to detect this.

Thirdly, the project did not fully utilize its relationship with the Mekong Private Sector Development Facility (MPDF), which was supposed to provide valuable support particularly in identifying potential investee companies for the fund. The completion report of the technical assistance (TA) project that is supporting SME growth in the Mekong region stated that the MPDF assisted 129 SMEs in preparing bankable business plans - 9 in Cambodia, 16 in the Lao PDR, and 104 in Viet Nam. The total project costs amounted to $109.0 million of which external financing raised was $60.4 million.

Finally, the fund and the resulting management fees were too small. MCL management fees were so small that it could only afford one office, in Viet Nam, and the fund never invested in Cambodia or the Lao PDR. More thought should have been given to the management of firm operations and economics.",Regional: REG: MEKONG ENTERPRISE FUND (MEF),34907-014,,http://www.adb.org/projects/34907-014/main#project-pds,Finance,,,,Infrastructure finance and investment funds,,,,,,,,Inclusive Economic Growth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,4832,sfx06

The clarity of the project's purpose, objectives, processes, and procedures helped ensure the government's commitment and focus in implementing the project, and fostered effective coordination at the national and provincial levels. This validation concurs with the PCR explanation that certain institutional factors, like the use of cost norms in capital expenditure budgeting, led to start-up delays and should therefore be addressed by the government. Receptivity and capacity to adjust to changes in loan administration policy and procedures, and the prompt action on the recommended reforms in rural infrastructure rehabilitation works are important lessons for both the government and ADB in designing and implementing this project. Future interventions to address similar emergency situations through any modality akin to the emergency assistance loan (EAL) have to be doubly scrutinized. Projects for EAL consideration should be selected more carefully. The delivery of the desired outputs, especially those that are capital expenditures in nature, could easily be constrained or at worst derailed by restrictions that are inherent in such assistance, but not often seen in ordinary program and/or project loan operations. Rehabilitating damaged infrastructure and facilities often take a long time, and sometimes require redesign to be sustainable. ADB- supported rehabilitation efforts also have to be synchronized with those of other donors and humanitarian relief organizations with vast experiences in disaster relief and mitigation to ensure timely delivery, quality, and immediate impact of the assistance.

Mongolia: Second Phase of the Governance Reform Program,,http://www.adb.org/documents/mongolia-second-phase-governance-reform-program,16-09-14,,Mongolia,,Validation of Project/Program Completion Report,,PVR Partly/less than successful,,,,,,"This validation agrees with the project completion report (PCR) on the general lessons drawn from the Second Phase of the Governance Reform Program (GRP II) and it offers additional lessons.

The Managing Government Expenditure prescription on the public financial management (PFM) would be appropriate: (i) never transpose into a different social and economic context reforms introduced elsewhere, without in-depth assessment of their impact and requirements and appropriate adaptation if necessary; (ii) never move beyond the basics until one is certain that the basics have been set right; (iii) never hope for a quick-and-easy technical solution to complex and long- standing budget process problems; and above all, (iv) keep the local authorities firmly in charge of the reform process, and never assume that the 'experts' are invariably right.

In view of the difference in opinion with development partners regarding the approach that should have been taken, even if already ensconced in a law (Public Sector Management and Finance Law), the product of earlier efforts to improve PFM in the country should have been subjected to greater scrutiny and raised certain concerns. Moreover, given the complexity and comprehensiveness of the program, as different government agencies and bodies were involved, much greater preparatory work should have been undertaken in formulating the program to properly adapt the scope, time frame of reforms, available resources, and institutional capacity to its proper pacing and sequencing. (For example, review of the basics, identifying weaknesses and deficiencies of the system, consensus building among all stakeholders, identifying causes of dissatisfaction with the process and the incentive framework, e.g., local governments complain their investment plans are not being taken into account as the process is centrally driven.)

For complex, complicated, and broad-based programs such as the GRP II, close monitoring is a must, such that greater responsibility can wholly or partly be devolved to the resident mission, with appropriate in-house expertise. In view of capacity limitation on the part of the government, closer and more intensive handholding would have been indicated, such that deploying in-house medium-to-long-term experts would have been advisable.",Mongolia: Governance Reform Program II,35376-013,"The goals of the Second Governance Reform Program (GRP-II) is to enhance accountability and efficiency of the public sector of Mongolia, to be measured by fiscal sustainability and tangible improvments in delivery of key public services.

Most of these suggestions seem to be improvements in procedures during project preparation stage, rather than lessons. One lesson that can be highlighted is that improving the uptake of housing loans by the urban poor requires an adequate supply of housing units that suit their requirements, complemented by pro-poor loan procedures, such as fixed interest rates and flexible repayment terms. Another lesson is the need to properly phase consultancy support over the project's implementation period in view of the weak institutional capacity.

The PCR recommended that ADB should not approve funding for projects without independent evaluation and diligent review. The PCR questioned the sector loan approach because one subproject that was identified after loan approval took longer to process than planned. Delegation of loan administration to the Viet Nam Resident Mission improved the ability of ADB to monitor project. Lastly, cofinancing works well when the cofinancier accepts ADB rules and procedures for equipment procurement.

This validation agrees with the last two lessons regarding the delegation of loan administration to the resident mission and to the common rules and procedures for procurement. However, this validation does not concur with the first two lessons. The first lesson pertaining to the conduct of an independent evaluation and review is, in essence, a recommendation. There is also little justification provided for this recommendation in terms of cost and effectiveness. The conclusion that the sector approach was ineffective because one subproject experienced delays seems unwarranted.

In addition, ADB should have foreseen the risk of a new entity, the National Power Transmission Corporation (NPTC), which was significantly different from the designated implementing and executing agencies, and that this could possibly interfere in project implementation arrangements. At design, such risk should have been mitigated through appropriate loan and/or finance agreement clauses.

(i) Including detailed implementation plans for the project's first year would have prevented delays during implementation.

(ii) The implications of any major reallocation of project resources should have been well calculated.

(iii) In piloting pro-poor health schemes, the government should have contributed more to ensure ownership and commitment. Comprehensive social health protection mechanisms such as the Health Equity Fund (HEF) (mostly supported by donors) should have been independently evaluated, especially its cost-effectiveness, financial sustainability, and mechanisms prior to expanding nationwide.

(iv) Identifying mechanisms to enhance transparency would have increased the HEF's efficiency.

(v) The targeting mechanism should have been evaluated prior to scaling up the HEF scheme.

Discussions on expected prior actions (or policy triggers) combined with tentative policy actions for the medium term as well as monitoring of higher-level sector results gave ADB and other partners the platform for continuing engagement in the context of the government's own development program. A series of single-tranche loans provide the flexibility to support medium-term oriented reforms. This validation appreciates the PCR lessons, and notes that (i) a key benefit of continuing engagement and dialogue is the expanded trust between development partners and government, which reduces transaction costs on both sides; and (ii) the need to ensure that laws and regulations produced are implemented to yield desired outcomes.

This validation notes two issues with the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) and/or the Support the Implementation of Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) format. First, as reported in the PCR, budget support from the PRSCs went directly into the state budget. Line agencies that have participated in the policy dialogue and have achieved policy actions may not directly benefit from budgetary increases. Therefore, the link between agency performance and direct budgetary benefits was not clear. Second, this validation notes that the link between various detailed policy actions and outputs and monitored outcomes (high-level sector results) were often unclear, even to the line agencies and ministries that are principally accountable for the outcomes. This validation concurs with the PCR's observation that sensible intermediate indicators are required to bridge and clarify the links between various policy actions and high-level outcomes.

The criteria for the qualification of contractors under a joint venture and for the award of multiple contracts should be strengthened. The PCR did not elaborate how this can be accomplished. This needs to be further assessed to formulate concrete steps to ensure that prequalified contractors are indeed capable as claimed and have the technical and financial resources to complete the proposed project. While performance bond requirements seek to guarantee contractor performance, this seemed ineffective under this project. There is also a need to strengthen provisions related to contractors' performance, such as mobilization, staffing, deployment of equipment and funds, release of payments, bonus for early completion, and penalties so that poor contractor performance could be discouraged. Likewise, the performance of the contractor should be assessed at the initial stages of the contract and the decision on termination, if warranted, should not be delayed.

The project experiences highlighted the complex process of community empowerment, which involves some rebalancing of power between citizens and government and among community groups. Community facilitators need to be carefully selected and trained. In retrospect, the project would have benefited from more time for community dialogue and learning accompanied by systematic monitoring to ensure that (i) beneficiaries are involved in all stages of planning and implementation, and (ii) the community actually perceives their growing influence over resource and investment decisions. Participation can be further promoted using a simpler funds-flow mechanism (e.g., direct transfers to community accounts) and by facilitating both the organizational and technical aspects of the civil works. Public trust of managers and/or decision makers also needs to be built. All village administrations should publicly post information on budgets and contracts and procurement decisions. Further technical training and more community dialogue are needed to form workable operation and maintenance plans. Insufficient time or attention was given on these toward the end of the project. The project could have benefited from a longer implementation period.

At loan processing, advance procurement action was even allowed to expedite implementation. There was recognition early on that the multitranche financing facility (MFF) modality being new, the borrower would have to be guided through the process. The capacity of the Pakistan Resident Mission (PRM) was enhanced to respond to client needs during implementation in constant coordination with the responsible project officer in Manila.

This validation further notes that the capability of the National Highway Authority (NHA) to use ADB processes and procedures needed to be strengthened to avoid implementation delays. These included procurement, financial reporting, and implementation of social safeguards. It is a common experience that road right-of-way acquisition and compensation was a sensitive social issue to be given priority by the government.

The validation holds a similar view. Consequently, ADB's similar institutional reform programs in Afghanistan should include a specific and realistic strategy for capacity development, taking into account the following: (i) without absorptive capacity in ministries, very little technical skills transfer will occur; (ii) sustained recourse to resident international advisors may perpetuate the dependency of decision makers on such advisors; and (iii) in the absence of specific terms of reference for international advisors, their contributions will tend to crowd out inputs provided by the learning process of local staff.

In addition, regarding program design in small, transition economies, it may be more prudent to take a gradual approach to private sector and financial market development, taking smaller slices of the development pie (financed with single-tranche loans) within a short time horizon. This should be supported by an agreed road map, matched closely with available institutional capacities, with enough flexibility for continuing review and corrective actions, and supported by required technical assistance, until such time that the country exhibits maturity of institutions, strong internal capacity, and political and economic stability.

Targets and expected outputs should be realistic and not be too ambitious in scale.

On the reform process side, close consultation involving the government, ADB, and other development partners is important for success, strengthening the government's ownership and increasing the potential for buy-in. Commitment of all stakeholders, regional as well as the national government, is essential. Effective coordination and information sharing are essential to successfully implement a project involving government agencies and numerous stakeholders.

Early consultant support should be provided to the executing agency to assist in the design of procurement procedures. More consideration needs to be given to procurement concerns when designing a program and project such as this involving information technology hardware and software, which require a precise and timely procurement process due to the fast- changing pace of technology and the risk of obsolescence.",Indonesia: Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Program,36541-013,"The overall goal of the Program is to enhance transparency, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of basic services at regional level.

The two other PCR lessons, that this validation endorses, relate more to the experience of this project. First, in a context of decentralization, establishing appropriate city management and monitoring arrangements is essential to supervise administrative and technical aspects and provide support to community neighborhoods. Second, covering a vast number of cities spread over almost the entire country may not be an effective way of maximizing the use of resources. Instead, a focused geographic approach would have provided flexibility for designing better social and economic benefits.

In view of these, the validation adds that - first, accurate estimates and monitoring of cost and technical parameters and reporting of them are essential for good project design, not least for calibrating the correct scale of complementary components. Work on shelter for the poor in Indonesia in this case, should take advantage of the country's long and extensive experience in this sector. Second, it is important for ADB to monitor the engagement of key project players to ensure their ownership of a project and support for its purpose and actions. The successful implementation of the shelter finance component in this case might have had a better chance with greater ADB attention to the participation of shareholder institutions.",Indonesia: Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector Project,35143-013,"The objective of the Project is to reduce income poverty and quality-of-life poverty in urban areas.

Irrigation management transfer (IMT) programs are more likely to succeed if these are packaged with 'a full range of interlinked interventions, including social, organizational, financial, marketing, engineering, and agriculture extension.'

This validation, however, has reservations on the lessons relating to subproject selection. The first lesson says, 'When selecting subprojects, first, the potential beneficiaries and water user association (WUA) members must be judged regarding if they have a genuine interest in taking responsibility to accept management of the asset independently or at least with minimum government support.' The communities that have these characteristics are usually the richer ones; including this as a criterion for project selection would have an anti-equity bias. Perhaps the broader lesson in this regard is that social preparation should be incorporated in projects where active beneficiary participation is emphasized for project's success.

With regard to the lesson that 'Project supervision by the resident mission is more efficient and is preferred by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF),' the arrangement apparently worked on this project. The advantages of having the resident mission supervise a project are easy to see.

It is clear that the economic viability of the 33 subprojects would be compromised by either an extreme increase in construction costs or a sharp drop in the rice price, or heavy rain damage as in 2008.

It is also emphasized that project targets aimed at including vulnerable groups (women and ethnic groups) should be based on a thorough understanding of realities and local institutional capacity. In the project's gender action plan, the goal of reducing rice deficits was to be achieved by having women constitute 50% of farmers. Since rural women, by tradition, are fully active in farming, the 50% target was irrelevant. Moreover, there was no logical link between rice deficits and the number of female farmers.

The PCR noted that while world rice prices are beyond the control of any project, the importance of applying strict cost-effectiveness criteria in subproject selection is an important lesson learned.

Stakeholder analysis and ways to ensure the commitment of stakeholders to project design initiatives is thus recommended. Second, project monitoring should be close enough to identify if key project design assumptions are being put at risk (such as when the Local Government and Rural Development Department (LGRDD), through the project coordination office (PCO), became the executing agency of the project), and if consequent shifts in project direction are likely (such as when PCO management was taken over by staff members deputed from the Housing, Urban Development and Public Health Engineering Department and focus was shifted toward infrastructure investments), and to avoid the shift in direction unless all parties agree to it.

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity is limited in the Pacific especially approaches to impact evaluation.

Given that multiple streams of funding for HIV/AIDS were already available, it may have been more efficient for ADB to work in partnership with another donor who had more experience and technical expertise in HIV/AIDS.

In the case of contingencies, the increase in cost was so significant that current methods for estimating contingency requirements would not be sufficient.

The validation identified two lessons from the project, as follows: (i) The skills in project management of the executing and implementing agencies' staff, including the management of consultants, needs to be upgraded. Considering that this was the first ADB loan for the transport sector in Armenia, the agencies were not familiar with ADB policies, systems, and requirements and would need to have sufficient capacity development in these particular skills; and (ii) The MOTC and ARD should give importance in operationalizing the PPMS, which seems to have been overlooked.

Given the regular government system that staff was used to, confusion occurred with the concurrent addition of another procedure. While ADB provided capacity building, there should be more hands-on intervention with on-site coaching during the early stages of project implementation. In the case of Viet Nam, the executing agencies were the two provincial people's committees, which were not familiar with and had no experience in implementing ADB projects. The situation worsened when they were subsequently given responsibility for implementing part B, which led to problems in coordinating consultant inputs.

The pre-feasibility study that prepared the project design and appraised the viability of the subprojects had quality issues, given that two airport projects in Cambodia were cancelled due to poor market viability, the airport project in the Lao PDR had to be redesigned due to the need to expand scope, the site for the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Siem Reap was not firmed up and substantial time was wasted looking for an alternative site, and others.

This validation found that some of these were already corrected by standard practices, such as estimates for physical and price contingencies, and conduct of geotechnical surveys in the process of road design, which were assumed to have been done. At appraisal, it was already anticipated that the procurement process would delay project implementation, hence, ADB concurred to advance corresponding action.

This validation identifies several important lessons from the project. First, more in-depth involvement by the borrower, executing agency, and implementing agencies in the preparation of the project design is important. The cancellation during the implementation of two subcomponents, which were essential to project sustainability, seemed too late since resources have already been committed. Agreeing to the changes should have triggered the revision of the design and monitoring framework (DMF). Second, the procurement process for consultancy services and civil works was too long in spite of approval by ADB to advance corresponding action. ADB and the executing agency should have agreed on the length of the procurement process, which was already set in the ADB procurement guidelines. The delay in the core team consultant (CTC) procurement led to national consultants being tapped to proceed with the project and avoid delays. While not apparent, this could have led to shortcuts in road design being taken, such as the absence of geotechnical studies in road sections with difficult terrain and soil conditions. Third, a project performance monitoring system (PPMS) was not required, since an existing system was already in place at Directorate General of Highways (DGH). However, ADB did require the conduct of surveys and collection of data for specific performance indicators identified at appraisal, which should have been finalized during the early stage of project implementation.",Indonesia: Road Rehabilitation II,34159-013,"The main objectives of the project are: economic growth by fostering mobility, trade, investment; help reduce poverty; and maintain national cohesion.

These lessons pointed out that (i) the cluster leader schools (CLS) model with decentralized training cascade is an effective model for continuous professional development training; (ii) e-learning is for both teachers and students and requires new pedagogical skills, which is an important transition from teacher-centered to student-centered pedagogy; (iii) smooth implementation and efficient procurement and consultant engagement could have been improved if there was an in-depth assessment of the procurement capacity of the project implementation unit (PIU) and the executing agency; and (iv) without timely monitoring and evaluation, an opportunity to demonstrate improved sector performance was missed.

This validation offers two additional lessons. First, the project design should have focused primarily on components 1 and 2, and only those parts of components 3 and 4 that were doable, by taking into account the capacity of the executing agency in implementing these components. A more accurate assessment of its capacity should have been conducted at project preparation stage. Second, the project's main objective is to improve the quality, relevance, and equitable access to basic education in Uzbekistan by using information and communications technology (ICT). However, the report and recommendation of the president (RRP) and the PCR had limited discussions on this main objective, presumably because the project was being implemented alongside other projects in the education sector.

First, to help avoid serious delays during implementation as with this operation, project preparation must (i) ensure that a request to propose consulting services is ready, (ii) approve all advanced actions for procurement of consulting contracts to be able to field consultants early during implementation, (iii) ensure that feasibility studies will be ready for government approval early on, and (iv) prepare tender documents for the first contract package. Second, to attract and retain the high quality professional staff needed to ensure the timely and continuous implementation of a project to its successful completion, the project management unit (PMU) and project implementation units (PIUs) must be able to offer competitive market compensation to interested and qualified candidates. Project implementation in this case suffered because of the poor capacity of the staff of these units. Third, especially when implementation is proving difficult, the project midterm review should be seized as an opportunity, within its budget envelope, to thoroughly review the project's scope and the realism of its implementation schedule. Another lesson, not brought out by the PCR, is the need of a project of this kind to pay attention to broader issues of water resource management.

Other PCR lessons that are obvious and well-known are needing to reduce implementation delays and ensuring that water supply networks have raw water to distribute and uninterrupted power to pump it. In addition to these lessons, the validation points out that the decision by ADB to waive an appraisal mission should not be taken lightly. In this case, the lack of an appraisal mission may have contributed to insufficient attention to both key aspects of project design and to ensuring borrower ownership. Also, without proper monitoring and evaluation with baseline data, targets, and reported results, the achievement of intended public health impacts by a project like this might occur but will be impossible to demonstrate.",Uzbekistan: Western Uzbekistan Rural Water Supply Project,35496-013,"The main objective of the Project is to improve the living and health conditions in the rural communities in Karakalpalstan and Khorezm.

ADB, the Government of Sindh, and the CDGK should have been far more insistent at the outset of the project on issues related to critical reform and governance than was the case in this project.

The design could have responded to the lack of consensus by encouraging early and committed buy-in through a step-by-step enlarging of the scope of urban development issues starting with the more manageable small components. In a context where lack of commitment by the borrower (and multiple stakeholders) is a known high risk, complex projects should be avoided - projects with a small number of stakeholders and with only one reform agenda would have more chances of success.

ADB should carefully examine the incentives of the executing and implementing agencies in utilizing technical assistance (TA) resources. It may be noted that other TA loans in Pakistan have been fully utilized.

The validation suggests highlighting two important lessons from the positive experience with this loan. First, using a technical assistance (TA) loan for project preparation instead of wrapping that stage into a loan for the investment project did save significantly on commitment charges to the borrower and may well have accelerated overall achievement of the eventual project. To get the best results from this formula, it is important to limit the coverage of the TA loan to support for the actions or documents needed for the first year or 2 years of project implementation. Second, it can be very useful and not excessively costly to have the final detailed design of a complex project subjected to review by an independent design appraisal consultant as was required by the Vietnamese government for this case.

There are limits to what could be done during preparation for the highway upgrade project which itself will likely experience some difficulty during the early years of commercial operation. Several aspects of the ensuing project, which justify some concern at the time of TA loan implementation, relate to (i) the importance of financial sustainability of the expressway and of Viet Nam Expressway Corporation (VEC) more generally - for maintenance of the road, management of operations, and fulfillment of debt-service obligations; (ii) the extent to which environmental impact assessment prepared under the TA loan has in practice proven satisfactory; and (iii) whether the plans for mitigation of social side effects and for development of new livelihoods have proven adequate and feasible.",Viet Nam: GMS Kunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor - Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway Project,33307-023,"The Project is designed to provide (i) a 244-kilometer grade-separated and access-controlled highway, including 10 interchanges with toll booths and five service areas, starting at Noi Bai in a suburb of Hanoi and ending at Lao Cai, on the border with the People's Republic of China (PRC) in northwest Viet Nam; (ii) electric, communications, and tolling systems and associated facilities, and the Vietnam Expressway Corporation's (VEC's) highway operation and maintenance (O&M) equipment and vehicles; and (iii) capacity building for VEC on management of project implementation, corporate financing management, O&M of highways, and safeguard planning and implementation.",http://www.adb.org/projects/33307-023/main#project-pds,Transport,,,,,,,,,Road transport (non-urban),,,Regional Integration,,,,"Governance and Capacity Development, Gender Equity and Mainstreaming, Knowledge Solutions",,,Some gender elements,,,,,,,,,,,,"O&amp;M, operation and maintenance",,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,5853,ztr7q

The main points discussed were the following: (i) the idea of creating an apex fund to seed 10 state-level funds was not successful and this could have been subjected to greater scrutiny during appraisal; (ii) the fund manager should have been given the flexibility to draw down the capital of the fund in accordance with its investment needs rather than at four pre-determined capital calls as this resulted in misallocation of resources; and (iii) the fund's investment in smaller companies did not perform well and this underscores the necessity of having rigorous due diligence processes in place for any fund.

This validation agrees with the issues, lessons, and recommendations identified by the XARR. In addition, it was noted that the fund manager strayed from the original intent of the Fund to focus its investments in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to invest in ventures with a view to taking the investee companies to the stock market. It is therefore recommended that ADB be more vigilant in monitoring and supervising fund managers of private equity funds to ensure that they adhere to the intended purposes and objectives of the Fund.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,4639,tdyts

Indonesia: Second and Third Development Policy Support Programs,,http://www.adb.org/documents/indonesia-second-and-third-development-policy-support-programs,27-12-12,,Indonesia,,Validation of Project/Program Completion Report,,PVR Successful/Generally successful,,,,,,"The project completion report (PCR) discussed five lessons that it considered relevant not only to ADB operations in Indonesia but also to operational planning in other developing member countries (DMCs). The first, on the usefulness of the program loan modality, there is no doubt that most DMCs would prefer this. But the success of this modality hinges much on the DMC's commitment to the reform program being pursued. Indonesia's case may be unique in that assistance came at the onset of a new political regime. Flexibility, however, is a constructive program attribute that benefits all parties.

The second and third lessons, donor coordination and coordination within government, are easier said than done. The Paris Declaration probably made coordination easier among donors. Within government, coordination between the main oversight agencies (Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs/CMEA, National Development Planning Agency/BAPPENAS, and Ministry of Finance/MOF) is not a problem, as these three agencies have been working together throughout. But as other ministries get involved, problems may arise. In the Development Policy Support Program series, for example, potential problem areas were encountered when other units of government were involved.

The fourth lesson, formulation of triggers and flexibility, may be subsumed under the first one. The last, strengthening change management capacity in government, has risks as well as opportunities. While technical support and advisory services to key agencies leading the reform process may have payoffs by way of facilitating future reform initiatives, they may backfire if other agencies not receiving such assistance feel left out of the reform process.",Indonesia: Third Development Policy Support Program,40272-013,"ADB is helping Indonesia meet key priorities under its medium-term growth and poverty reduction program.

Indonesia: Small and Medium Enterprise Export Development Project,,http://www.adb.org/documents/indonesia-small-and-medium-enterprise-export-development-project,27-12-12,,Indonesia,,Validation of Project/Program Completion Report,,PVR Unsuccessful,,,,,,"The lessons brought out by the project completion report (PCR) are valuable to ADB. A more rigorous economic assessment at appraisal on the likely environment under which the project would operate during implementation is important. This is particularly applicable to investment lending projects, which could be affected by changes in economic conditions and financial market environment. This validation views that periodic assessments of changing macroeconomic conditions could result to more informed decisions during implementation and better early warning signals.

Moreover, decisive action needs to be made on the unused portion of the loan to keep from incurring unnecessary resources and commitment fees. The PCR pointed out that project design was based on a traditional credit line modality of a public sector development finance institution. The loan structure included pricing that was not competitive.

Furthermore, strict conditions and restrictions on the loan proceeds constrained utilization of ADB's loan. Based on experience with this project, the PCR views that a public sector-type modality does not have much prospect for financing private banks and private sector enterprises, particularly in a growing economy with sizable liquidity and foreign exchange reserves. This validation agrees with this view. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will seek the cheapest funds and the most convenient sources available. Additionally, banks will use the cheapest source of funds to finance SME investments. The PCR suggested a more viable instrument for SME promotion using ADB's credit guarantee scheme under the Partial Credit Guarantee Facility, i.e., ADB's private sector window. This facility could be extended to selected viable banks operating at the regional level to guarantee SME loan portfolios up to a certain level without a counter guarantee from the government. ADB may consider this option in similar projects faced with high liquidity and foreign currency reserves in the market.",,36490-012,,http://www.adb.org/projects/36490-012/main#project-pds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,4669,odhwn

The complexity of the design with multiple components and subcomponents and several executing agencies posed a difficulty during project implementation. ADB staff was burdened with day-to-day involvement, which limited their ability to supervise and manage the project. In hindsight, it would have been helpful if implementation systems and procedures were simplified, and if the central project office (CPO) had taken a stronger role in overseeing and coordinating the project.

The bottom-up approach to the planning process was well received in the communes and districts. Experience with the project showed that participatory planning could be effectively introduced into large, complex, and integrated projects.

Technology introduced under the project was considered valuable by the beneficiaries. However, to some extent, it was introduced without recognition of traditional knowledge and experience. Technological advancement needs to be tempered with understanding of long-held cultural beliefs and approaches. This validation agrees with the PCR's view that the introduction of new technology needs to be built on local knowledge, not to entirely replace it.

The microfinance subcomponent did not operate as planned. The Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD), as a commercial lender, preferred to lend larger loan amounts to individuals than small loans to groups. Microloans were more costly to administer, which did not align with VBARD's commercial orientation. Many borrowers instead accessed their loans from the Social Policy Bank (SPB). In many districts, VBARD was not able to compete with the SPB. At appraisal, the project design should have taken into account the institutional environment for microfinance and the financing needs of targeted households.

It is important to a have an operational benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) to be able to effectively assess project performance and impact. Executing agencies and implementing agencies should be thoroughly oriented on the importance of the BME and trained on its use. They also need to be supported in the use of the system throughout the implementation period.

To ensure involvement of all joint venture partners in contract administration, it would be necessary for each partner to issue a guarantee against the collateral for their individual and joint liability. Issuance of individual and joint liability along with a performance bond would ensure liability for the work among all joint venture partners.

There were some difficulties in contract administration between the Department of Customs (DOC) and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Although the contract for the Automatic System of Customs Cargo Clearance and Management (ASYCUDA) was signed between DOR and UNCTAD, DOC was the main agency to supervise UNCTAD's work. DOC felt that it was less effective in the UNCTAD contract implementation because it was not a party to the contract. Contract provisions should have clearly stated the role, responsibilities, and implementation arrangements of DOC.

The government needed to review and include interim milestone dates in the contract documents to ensure timely work completion and avoid extensions. The government also needed to institutionalize a safeguard system within the organizational framework of the project, particularly during implementation, for effective monitoring and supervision of and timely compliance with safeguard covenants.

Reform measures that involve reorganizing and downsizing a large and well-entrenched organization such as the Financial Supervisory and Development Board (Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan or BPKP) are generally difficult to implement. There were complex issues that involved changes in seniority, salaries, staff positions, and political ramifications that should have been thoroughly assessed. BPKP resistance should have been anticipated since the reform entailed significant downsizing.

Implementing a program that requires reforms at the level of a national agency, inter- agency coordination and cooperation needs the highest political support. The PCR pointed out that the conditions for release of the first tranche should have included a reorganization plan for BPKP. This would have demonstrated the government's commitment to reorganize BPKP. Subsequently, the second tranche should have been conditional on the government beginning to implement the reorganization. This would have given ADB more leverage to move the program toward reorganizing BPKP.

At the program level, ADB should continue dialogue with the government in pursuing the reform and ensuring that BPKP strictly adhere to its new scope of work and tasks identified in the new regulation (no. 60/2008).

(i) Local government unit (LGU)-driven projects are important and strategic for targeting the urban poor. LGUs could have played a crucial role in provision of land, particularly land that the President of the Philippines has proclaimed for social housing purposes. Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) lending needed to open up to LGU-initiated socialized housing projects, even if they were for non-HDMF members. To serve the urban poor, LGUs needed to innovate and provide guarantee funds (guaranteed by the internal revenue allotment [IRA] or other forms of collateral) for HDMF lending operations to the urban poor. In addition, implementation of socialized housing projects needed to make use of microfinance institution (MFI) collection practices.

(ii) Private developers needed to be given incentives to allocate part of their housing projects to the urban poor.

(i) A complex and overambitious program should not have been designed. A simpler program designed in phases or steps might have been more realistic and would have stood a greater chance of achieving better results.

(ii) There was a mismatch between the program's expectations from those of the executing agency and the implementing agencies, and their capacity to deliver such expectations.

In future similar interventions, it would be better to design complex projects in trances or sequentially, starting with simple components and sequencing them in such a way that more complex components are implemented in later tranches. This would allow the executing agencies and/or implementing agencies to build capacity and experience in the simpler components; learn technical and project management issues that could be addressed; and revisit project concept, approaches, methodologies, implementing and financing arrangements as necessary before proceeding to subsequent tranches or phases. Because of the difficulty in interagency coordination and multiagency project implementation in the Philippines, mre careful focus and in-depth assessment of the implementation capacity of executing agencies and/or implementing agencies, their governance and management structure, institutional framework and design of implementation arrangements would need to be undertaken prior to appraisal.

If the government seriously intended to achieve the development objectives, the issues, especially those pertaining to interagency coordination should have been addressed at the Cabinet or National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board level.

Perhaps, a more prudent approach would have been to adopt a more phased approach by first focusing on, say, development of insurance, leasing, money markets, and capital markets and then, as second stage, addressing concerns in financial infrastructure, i.e., the accounting and auditing system, and a deposit insurance system.

However, very few indicators relate to the long-term changes in social behavior that the project was designed to deliver.

Closer attention to the linkages (or the theory of change) between the provision of infrastructure and the resulting changes in social behavior and development outcomes may have been a more useful basis for project monitoring and evaluation (M&E), i.e., what were the behavior changes and could they be observed in project and non-project towns? This lesson applies more broadly to infrastructure projects that identify high level social outcomes and explicit behavior change for their longer-term success.

These were as follow:

(i) Avoid making investments based on the popularity of certain transactions or sectors, and thoroughly analyze markets for demand trends to avoid venturing into sunset industries.

(ii) Diversification of the investment portfolio - geographically and by industry - is vital to mitigate the unexpected performance shortfalls of a specific industry.

(iii) The sector diversification strategy should be reevaluated, because the 50% exposure limit for a single industry is very high. This has been taken into account in subsequent funds into which ADB has invested.

(iv) In infrastructure funds, it is essential to spread investments across different stages of project development (i.e., early stage and fully operational).

(v) Avoid further losses, and do not invest additional money in nonviable activities.

(vi) ADB should continue to participate more actively in fund structuring (especially in terms of a fund's investment policies to ensure alignment with ADB's objectives), in appraising fund managers, and in supervision.

(vii) ADB's investment in funds can effectively mobilize larger sums of capital that complement ADB's direct investment efforts. Although the Asian Infrastructure Fund (AIF) represents a small fraction of the region's infrastructure requirements, ADB has demonstrated the viability of this means of mobilizing capital while ensuring that projects are aligned with ADB's development objectives.

(viii) Investing through investment funds can be equally effective as, and has advantages in comparison with, direct equity investments. Investment funds can make simultaneous investments, as opposed to direct investments into a single project.

First, this validation finds that for clarity the lessons should have been separated from
the recommendations. Second, pertinent points were identified but the quality of the lessons and recommendations statements is poor and could have been stated better by providing more context. For instance, item (ii), as stated, is neither a lesson nor a recommendation but merely a definition of what is diversification. Similarly, items (vii) and (viii) are basically just describing what investment funds are and their advantages over direct investments. On the other hand, item (iv) does not explain why it is essential to spread investments across different stages of project development. Item (iii) is confusing because the first part says the sector diversification strategy should be reevaluated but then the second part states that it has already been taken into account in subsequent ADB fund investments. It is not clear from the statement whether the 50% single-industry exposure limit is a standard ADB investment policy or specific to AIF.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,4828,tmu0

2. In establishing viable private agricultural services institutions in transition economy, it is important that the target farmers' willingness to avail of these services (in the short and long term) and their capacity to pay are assessed and considered during project design and implementation. Under the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project in Uzbekistan, the Rural Business Advisory Center (RBAC) and the Machinery and Tractor Pool (MTL) were intended to be self-sufficient by project end. This is unlikely to happen for the MTL as the institution's targeted small cash-strapped farmers are inherently the most challenged to make payments for availed services. Likewise, comments from target farmers indicate that demand for services from the RBAC are only confined during the early stages of the project.

As programs need to be driven by the borrowers, capacities of executing and implementing agencies in program implementation must be carefully assessed at appraisal so that capacity disparities can be mitigated. For example, the Punjab Resource Management Program in Pakistan could have averted problems brought about by capacity gaps had it identified the risks early on and instituted mitigating measures, such as, the recruitment of program management consultants to assist the Project Management Unit, the Planning and Development Department, and the Finance Department. The limited institutional capacity of the executing and implementing agencies ultimately reduced the relevance of the Program. [Main text, paras. 14, 25-26, 30]

More innovative cost sharing arrangements need to be developed so that poor local government units (LGUs) are not hindered from participating in programs that require counterpart equity. Under the Secondary Education Development and Improvement Project in the Philippines, LGU involvement was incorporated into the school building program to promote partnership with local stakeholders. The program required LGUs to provide 25% of the construction costs for the required school facilities. Unfortunately, most participating LGUs found it difficult to provide equity funds which led to postponed construction. [PVR Main text, para. 21; see also PCR Main text, para. 21]

First, the community empowerment initiative (CEI) needs to be replicated and further improved. By extending the benefits of national road development, ADB road sector projects will get more support and facilitate economic growth and poverty reduction more effectively. (ADB approved a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant of $3 million to carry out a nationwide program to diffuse, promote, and provide training for community-based local infrastructure works, especially roads, and to support further work on maintenance programs. ADB.) The coverage and quality of the maintenance that can be expected on project roads should be thoroughly assessed and spelled out upfront before future interventions in the country. Meanwhile, ADB should consider a sector-wide approach rather than standalone maintenance contracts to make road investments sustainable. Timor-Leste needs a road sector maintenance program and this program must include an institutional set-up, a policy framework, programming, implementation capacity, and funding that are effective and adequate. Finally, in a country where data is scarce, of relative poor quality, and thus hard to interpret, economic and social analysis and monitoring and evaluation of projects need to focus on individual subprojects rather than broad aggregations.

2. Technical assistance (TA) activities that are well integrated into the overall project can result in more effective provision of guidance to achieve project outputs. This reiterates the importance of effectively timing TA interventions when supporting investment projects so as to maximize value addition. In the case of the Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project in the People's Republic of China, the TA played a catalytic role in strengthening interagency and multisector cooperation and collaboration for integrated ecosystem management (IEM), including the collection and sharing of IEM-related data and information among policy decision makers, legislators, planners, private sector, and communities. The consultants served as lead resource persons and technical support in (i) various training activities, (ii) completion of IEM strategies and action plans, (iii) formulation and revision of 33 local laws and regulations, and (iv) implementation of 18 pilot sites.

There are clear benefits to involving ADB resident missions in project supervision.These include closer (hands-on) involvement and better understanding of the local environment. In the case of the Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project in Kyrgyz Republic, significant disbursement delays were reported prior to 2005. The situation improved after the Kyrgyz resident mission began screening withdrawal applications. In 2007, ADB transferred responsibility for project administration from ADB headquarters to the resident mission. This resulted in stronger coordination with the executing agency and improved project administration. [PVR Main text, paras. 19, 24; see also PCR Main text, para. 64]

2. To adequately apprise ADB of the severity of project problems, projects may require (i) in-depth analysis by missions, and (ii) a established mechanism for consultants to prepare realistic reports to project management units (PMUs) and ADB. In the case of the Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project in the Kyrgyz Republic, project documents revealed that in the early years of the project, the PMU or consultants did not adequately apprise review missions on the seriousness of the project's problems (e.g., 45 subprojects had unsatisfactory performance due to problems relating mainly to poor design, construction, and operation and maintenance).

Before a similarly complex and ambitious project is prepared, particularly in a country with difficult socioeconomic conditions and generally weak implementation and coordination capacity, a detailed and objective analysis of implementation risks (especially the strengths and weaknesses of the executing and implementing agencies) would have been essential, with all necessary mitigation measures built into the project design. The scope of the project was too broad - provincial roads should not have been included in a rural development project.

The risks associated with a change in scope (in this case the inadequate capacity of the executing/implementing institution) needs to be fully considered to prevent project failure. For example, experience with the Financial Management Project in Papua New Guinea (PNG) pointed to the importance of ensuring that institutional capacity exists carrying out changes, i.e., technical aspects of the project design. The decision to combine components 1 and 2 during its third year of implementation, and to fund the development of an integrated software package that could cover all activities under these two components introduced a huge risk to the project. The use of an integrated system for public sector financial management was rare even in developed countries, and required technical sophistication in the development and operations phase that was nonexistent in PNG. This change in design led to implementation delays, and adversely affected project outputs and outcomes. It also reduced the relevance of the project. [Main text, paras. 10, 20]

To improve the success of policy reform interventions, there is a need to ensure that executing and implementing institutions have adequate capacities in terms of staff and skills to supervise the implementation and operationalization of the reforms. For example, the Bank of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) under the Banking Sector Reform Program in Lao PDR could have rigorously supervised and controlled the banking system had it acquired adequate capacity to do so. Its lack of capacity still partly explain the continuing weak financial positions and nonperforming loans of state-owned commercial banks in Lao PDR. [Main text, paras. 14, 19]

These include:

(i) Projects should conduct further research to ensure a viable approach is developed.

(ii) Project designs should be more cognizant of the security situation in countries where security concerns prevail.

(iii) ADB should resist requests to change the design or implementation arrangements early in implementation (unless there are clear design deficiencies).

(iv) The activities and output requirements of the design and monitoring framework (DMF) should be clear to the executing agency and the project management unit (PMU).

(v) The officer responsible for project design should be involved in the initial stages of project management to ensure a smooth transition from processing to implementation.

(vi) The concept of a sustainable self-funding Rural Enterprise Modernization Company (REMC) providing business development services in markets with limited ability to pay was inappropriate as the services provided are public benefits which are traditionally the role of government rather than private companies.

The lessons derived from the project pertain to approaches to community engagement in projects, technical procedures, and due diligence requirements. The PCR listed the following lessons related to community engagement: (i) demand-driven and community-based development require a flexible design to accommodate community preferences, (ii) enhancing community ownership requires that beneficiaries contribute cash and labor and give communities more responsibility for operation and maintenance (O&M), and (iii) handover of water supply to local communities requires continued support during transition and follow-up periods. The technical lesson identified pertains to groundwater investigations. The PCR suggested that such investigations should be conducted over time to determine variations in yield and recharge rates to avoid possible water shortages. Due diligence in monitoring safeguards and assessing political risks and national procurement regulations and procedures is necessary to avoid delays and possibly failure of some project components.

This validation agrees with these lessons. Substantial community awareness campaigns and community organization work are necessary to foster community interest, participation, and commitment. It takes considerable time to promote and build up community engagement. However, as the project showed, such engagement can ensure the success, viability, and sustainability of a project. The policy reforms that were envisaged at appraisal but not adopted may have been carried out had a more rigorous assessment of the prevailing political environment been undertaken before appraisal.

For a project with interrelated components funded from separate sources, it is important that a coordination mechanism is set in place to integrate and optimize outputs and impacts. For example, coordination between the ADB-funded components 1 and 2, and the Global Environment Fund-funded, United Nations Development Programme-administered component 3 was lacking in the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project in Cambodia. While the its design was well conceived with three separate but interrelated components, parallel financing arrangements and the creation of a separate Tonle Sap Conservation Project appear to have made it difficult to coordinate and integrate the project components. ADB's internal procedures somehow reinforced the notion that these were two separate projects. In addition, the project completion report team did not have complete information on the activities and disbursements of component 3. [Main text, paras. 26, 29]

To identify potential sector programming issues, ADB needs to actively engage with other development partners' on their investment plans prior to or in the early stage of loan implementation and match its own comparative advantage in offering assistance to a DMC. In the case of the Angat Water Utilization and Aqueduct Improvement Project in the Philippines where, instead of pursuing the ADB multitranche financing facility, the government opted for a loan from the Government of the People's Republic of China. The government deal with many official development assistance partners, and there are grants and loans with better conditions than ADB loans. While the project team insists that the government decision to change its funding source was unexpected, through project documents, the validation report did not find significant evidence suggesting that ADB actively explored other development partners' investment plans in the sector, prior to or in the early stage of the loan implementation, nor did it assess its own comparative advantage in offering its assistance to the Philippine development assistance environment in the water sector. A master plan for water resource development in each river basin including careful assessment of conflicting responsibilities for regulation, extraction, and approval in the sector is needed for future ADB engagement.

In the case of countries with potential debt service payment risks, incorporating a debt sustainability analysis in the risk and vulnerability assessment of the project can help anticipate the potential risks to ADB. In the Post-conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project, the country's severe budgetary constraint in early 2000 meant the government will be unable to finance any reconstruction work in the short term.

For lessons to be useful during project implementation, they need to be taken into account during the formulation and design stage. Listing lessons learned in the report and recommendation of the President is not enough. For example, the implementation of the Power Rehabilitation Project in Tajikistan would have benefited if at least some of the past  lessons were taken into account during its formulation and design. Many of the implementation problems arose because of the executing agency's (Barki Tajik) unfamiliarity with ADB's procurement procedures, and the appraisal mission was well aware that such unfamiliarity has delayed the start of many projects in Central Asia. These problems would have been avoided had this been taken into account in  the project's design and the executing agency provided the necessary familiarization training on ADB procurement procedures.

A strategy that can help avoid program implementation delays is the careful and realistic selection of policy interventions and to implement these in a phased manner. The Education Sector Development Program in Uzbekistan, being the first to be implemented in the country, encountered implementation delays because some of its aspects were too ambitious and should have been done sequentially.

a) Total project costs were lower than anticipated; the XARR cites unutilized contingencies and other savings. For this positive outcome to be repeated in other projects, the basis for the savings needs to be explained.

b) Actual power-generation capacity exceeded the projections in the RRP; the reasons for this should be explained so that they can be replicated in other projects if possible.

c) A brief payment dispute between the Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN), Mekong Energy Company Limited (MECO), and Viet Nam Oil and Gas Corporation regarding liability for pass-through gas take-or-pay payments in the months immediately before the commercial operations date is noted, when apparently the gas pipeline had been completed but the plants had not commenced commercial operations and EVN had not completed its transmission line to the plant. The Ministry of Industry successfully intervened in June 2005 and, according to the XARR, EVN settled its obligations in full to MECO. This seems to be attributable to the government's performance guarantee (through the Ministry of Industry) to MECO vis-a?-vis the national gas supplier and the national electricity offtaker. As this is a very positive aspect of the project, this type of government performance guarantee could be incorporated into similar projects in Viet Nam and other countries.",Viet Nam: VIE: MEKONG ENERGY COMPANY LIMITED (Phu My 2.2 Power),35914-014,,http://www.adb.org/projects/35914-014/main#project-pds,Energy,,,Conventional energy generation,,,,,Economic affairs management,"Road transport (non-urban), Urban roads and traffic management, Water transport (non-urban)","Other urban services, Urban solid waste management, Urban water supply",,Inclusive Economic Growth,,,,Private Sector Development and Private Sector Operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,5859,o81ko

To improve the prospects for successful project implementation, achieving the desired outcomes and outputs, and maintaining sustainability in the medium term: (i) the focus and selection of project components must consider the developmental context of the country and its absorptive capacity; and (ii) preparedness and viability of proposed component, including likelihood of their adoption by obtaining firm upfront commitments from the parties that champion their promotion, must be ascertained. Under the Small Business Development Project in Samoa, the latter does not appear to have been done  on one of its components, Venture Capital Fund (VCF). The report and recommendation of the president was more of a description of what the proposed VCF would look like. Many loose ends, including critical issues such as shareholder contributions, choice of the fund manager and key staff, and tax liability, were left to be sorted out during implementation which took time for resolution, and the VCF was closed without doing any business after determining that it was unlikely to be financially viable.

Emergency projects such as this one tend to be difficult to administer and implement and difficult for ADB to properly guide and oversee. This is because speed is of the essence to restore normal activity, and subprojects tend to be spread over large geographical areas. As such, ADB has to depend not only on review mission diligence but also on consultants and the government agencies involved. ADB's procedures, while fully adequate for non-emergency projects, tend to slow the implementation of emergency projects such as this one, so due diligence is sometimes truncated. As a result, subprojects were undertaken that do not meet requirements or necessary approvals. The social infrastructure projects under this project are cases in point. Prior to due diligence approval, works were undertaken and retro-financed after due diligence approval. Also, three of the new schools, while probably needed, did not meet subproject selection criteria. ADB may wish to review its procedures for such projects so that such compromising activities can be avoided. [Main text, page 9, section E(ii)]

There is a need to lay down a firm legal, regulatory, and supervisory foundation prior to embarking on promotion of financing institutions, such as savings and credit cooperatives (SCCs). In this case, ADB attempted to establish the regulatory structure in parallel to project implementation, which did not work well. The two activities should have been better prepared, and sequenced as separate projects. The regulatory structure should have been supported by a comprehensive technical assistance with adequate resources to prepare and promote the legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework, to have it passed by the legislature, and to ensure adequate institutional capacity to execute that framework. With the regulatory structure in place, the implementation should have proceeded with components for training, promotion, and institution development of SCCs. That approach would have had better prospects for success in establishing a sustainable rural finance system. [Main text, page 6, section E(ii.a)]

While it is important to correctly and objectively assess implementation constraints and implementation capacity, countries with serious development needs and weak institutional capacity should be assisted with building up this capacity as part of project design. This refers to short-term project implementation capacity as well as to longer-term program administration capacity.

This validation supports all of them. One of these pertains to the linking of loan tranche releases with conditions for the passage of new laws. The passage of laws by the Parliament is normally not within the control of ADB or the government. Therefore, the question arises whether such conditions should continue to be imposed by ADB or, if such links are made, whether more time should be allowed for the laws to be passed. In this case, the delay in the passage of the investment law led to the cancellation of the final loan tranche, and thus to diminished efficiency in resource use. Another lesson is the need to be aware, during program design, of present or future laws that could impede reform. In this case, the passage of the Decentralization Law (2001) appears to have delayed the enactment of the investment law and to have led to the cancellation of the final loan tranche.",,31644-013,,http://www.adb.org/projects/31644-013/main#project-pds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,4654,8nvjb

First, where an executing agency is unfamiliar with the sector approach, close dialogue with the relevant institutions is needed during the feasibility study and loan processing to ensure that all stakeholders understand the implications of such an approach. Projects such as this require intensive supervision by ADB in the early years and therefore ADB and government staff continuity is essential. Close involvement of resident mission staff is likewise important.

Second, participatory resource management projects involve complex arrangements between beneficiaries, intermediaries such as community-based organizations (CBOs) or nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and implementing agencies. Strengthening and sustaining these relationships require project support over many years. Introducing new beneficiary groups or CBOs toward the end of a project, without clearly defined means of support after project closure, is unlikely to result in sustainable outcomes.

Third, project designs should take into account the implementation capabilities of implementing agencies when a wide range of activities is proposed. The number of community development schemes implemented under the project was well below expectations. Reasons for this include lack of appropriately trained staff in the Department of Forests, Fisheries, and Wildlife (DFFW) and difficulty in contracting out design and supervision work.

While agreeing with lessons (iii) to (v), this validation, bearing in mind the experience with the endowment fund, considers that the earmarking of program loan funds for capacity development purposes was probably not the most effective mechanism to achieve the intended results.

Project experience raises a larger question: whether actions to improve labor rights and welfare are compatible with ADB's existing lending modalities of program, sector, and investment loans. The experience in Pakistan shows that existing ADB lending modalities do not allow for promotion of labor rights. Links between labor rights and welfare, good governance practices, poverty reduction, and the improvement of labor rights through loans by multilateral financing institutions are relatively under-researched, at least with respect to Pakistan. Given ADB's focus on good governance and poverty reduction, the PCR urges that those links be explored.

A multisector community development project must be organic in nature, i.e., it must be self- operating, which reduces the coordination demands on the executing agency and the need for monitoring by ADB. This can happen only if (a) the design includes comparatively more tested and proven interventions and fewer new initiatives; (b) the interventions are limited in number and strategic in nature; and (c) if a suitable executing agency and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are selected at the appraisal stage.

Given the sector mandate of line agencies in Pakistan, provincial planning and development departments are the best institutional homes for multisector projects, as these are the only departments with a multisector mandate. In addition, they have established reporting lines, and institutional relationships with line departments and district governments.

The approach of involving multiple district-based NGOs in community mobilization and selecting them through the national competitive bidding process was not successful because of (a) their lack of capacity, (b) politicization of the recruitment process, and (c) the lengthy and cumbersome process of recruitment through national competitive bidding.

Projects that are innovative in nature or complicated in design inherently involve delays and require intensive ADB supervision. Community development projects require additional time, and proper arrangements for community mobilization and social preparation processes. ADB experience shows that such projects should be designed with implementation periods of not less than 7 years.

At present, there is no system for acquiring accurate international roughness index data for provincial roads, which is important to cost and benefit assessment.

The road network in Sri Lanka is dense by international norms. Therefore, a priority maintenance assessment should be made for a core provincial road network, leaving the less important parts of the network to local authorities or even abandonment.

PCR also stated that follow-on projects should be restricted to one or two provinces at a time to better focus on institutional strengthening.

4. Most importantly, project experience would suggest that, when substantial parts of a project area are struck by a major natural disaster such as the 2005 earthquake, ADB should make a major effort to help the government redesign the project. While the project underwent two changes in scope, these related to increases in unit costs and, to a large extent, withdrawal from earthquake-affected districts. In such situations, ADB may in the future consider redesign to align the project with the needs for disaster recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction, meshed with assistance from other development partners. In the project, it may have been possible to effectively reorient the project to focus on reconstructing hospitals and schools in the affected districts or other aspects as decided by the government.

Civil works, particularly in urban areas, should be sequenced so that water supply, sewerage, drainage, and other projects requiring underground work are substantially complete prior to award of road contracts.

(a) Small contractors often lack financial as well as technical and project management capacity, which causes delay in mobilization and completion of the works.

It is important to emphasize further that, to succeed and be sustainable, microfinance programs must be professionally managed like any other business. Loans must be repaid and the microfinance institutions (MFIs) must operate efficiently to continue providing the much-needed financial services to poor households. The selection of an appropriate executing agency is a critical factor in the success of a microfinance program. Nonfinancial government agencies like the Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB), despite their strengths in rural development, lack the capability for sustainable microfinance programs that require specialized skills and good governance. An apex lending institution with proven experience in microfinance would have been the more appropriate choice.

Another lesson that can be drawn relates to the targeting of project participants. The project was designed to target the poorest, particularly widows, divorced and destitute women, and others with no regular source of income. However, some 33% of the beneficiaries were reported to be above the poverty line. While this is an indication that the selection criteria were not strictly applied, it also illustrates the limits of microfinance in reaching the poorest of the poor.

Experience with other ADB microfinance projects has shown that the poorest of the poor, despite being targeted in the design, generally do not constitute a significant proportion of the project beneficiaries. Moreover, microcredit often does not reach the poorest (those at the bottom of the income distribution). In practice, MFIs, driven by cost-efficiency and financial sustainability concerns, tend to target those with greater repayment capacity. The poorest also need a range of other services besides microfinance, such as training, health provision, livelihood, and social development. The destitute have very limited capacity for debt and often no income to repay loans. Thus, microfinance alone may not be the appropriate solution for them. Further, microfinance needs transparency and reporting of performance to work at its best. Irregular and unstandardized reporting on operations and financial management among the upazila bittaheen central cooperative associations (UBCCAs) made it difficult to monitor and respond on time to delinquency, repayment, and sustainability problems. MFIs must report accurately on financial and social indicators to perform better.

Experience from the implementation of the project highlights the need for effective support for sustainable MFIs.

Questions also arose in this regard on issues such as affordability, high intermediation costs, and difficulties of assessing risks. Perhaps, a more prudent approach could have been to address policy and institutional reforms through the program-based lending modality to strengthen institutions and policies to facilitate a greater availability of resources, and easier access thereto, on a sustainable basis, for meeting LIH housing requirements.

The Project showed that those who directly manage estate crop production, and who derive 50% or more of their household income from it, tend to practice integrated pest management (IPM) more seriously than those whose income is derived from other activities. Specifically, targeting this group would have greater development impact and would likely contribute to an even more widespread adoption of IPM.

The lack of a component on processing, marketing, and enterprise development, constrained farmers from taking advantage of market opportunities. In view of the growing demand for pesticide-free and organic farm produce, this would have benefited the farmers economically.

The project benefit monitoring and evaluation (PBME) system should have been established at the initial phase of implementation so that the progress and status of the Project could have been easily tracked, and necessary actions taken on time. Typically, the PBME system should include project performance indicators and a baseline socioeconomic survey that will be used for assessing socioeconomic impact.

The cluster modality is also a useful instrument for establishing benchmarks and unifying policy makers who advocate reforms. A move from a program cluster approach with several tranches each to a medium-term framework based on a series of single- tranche programs within a program cluster could be recommended to provide more flexibility while focusing on achievable, upfront outcomes. With such an approach, ADB could also support genuine commitment by relevant stakeholders over a longer period of time.

Poverty alleviation was a major ADB policy at the time of project approval, and IED considers that that a high level of civic participation in project implementation, along with the support of community organizations for the local civil works, can be applied to other ADB projects of this nature.

The funding and other resources allocated to establishing the systems for operating and maintaining the schemes were not in proportion to those allocated to physical works. There needs to be genuine recognition of the input required to establish the capacity to manage irrigation at the community level, and to embed improved farming practices. At appraisal there was not even a nominated counterpart agency for the agricultural improvement component. More appropriate design needs to be backed by more appropriate monitoring of project progress and the flexibility to apply additional resources to components that are not achieving their objectives.

(c) Delay in implementation from the time of project identification and appraisal often results in significant changes at the start of construction and during implementation. Means should be sought to minimize the impact of changes in design and civil works contracts.

This validation exercise also identified additional lessons for consideration in future ADB operations:

(a) To have a good road for 250 km, arrangements for parallel or cofinancing should have been explored at the start. In the absence of other financing source, this could have been part of a rolling program to ensure the entire road length was brought to a sustainable and trafficable standard.

This needs to be reviewed and considered further. Similarly, the PCR suggested that applying overseas environmental practices and standards was probably not appropriate to the RMI and the small level of subproject impact.

The country's poor financial situation was recognized as a risk from the beginning. The PCR rightfully raised the question as to '....whether ADB as the principle lender to RMI could have anticipated these difficulties and should have acted sooner' than it did to limit wasted time and resources. The answer is likely yes, but this would have required additional ADB resources for monitoring and analysis. Nevertheless, this is a relevant question that should be raised during preparation and implementation of future projects prepared under similar circumstances.

The Project also demonstrates the importance of fiscal sustainability, especially for operation and maintenance, and for large projects in small countries. Guidelines on economic analysis of projects stipulate that such analysis is necessary when a project is large in relation to the Borrower's economy.",Marshall Islands: Outer Island Transport Infrastructure Project,32208-013,,http://www.adb.org/projects/32208-013/main#project-pds,Transport,,,,,,,,,Water transport (non-urban),,,Inclusive Economic Growth,,,,"Governance and Capacity Development, Gender Equity and Mainstreaming",,,Some gender elements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,4834,7drld

One member expressed concerns that the Project would have difficulties with bureaucratic procedures in Viet Nam; another described the Project as high risk due to the perceived weakness of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in community-based approaches.

Project design must take more realistic account of existing institutions, processes, and procedures.

(a) a reform program formulated through the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) process is likely to enjoy strong government ownership and be successfully implemented;

(b) the large number of development agencies participating in the PRSC process in Viet Nam enables ADB to promote, with relatively small amounts of financing, a broad range of policy reforms that are needed for achieving the objective of its country strategy and program (CSP);

(c) the staff time required for ADB to participate in the PRSC process can be reduced or rationalized by focusing on policy actions that are particularly relevant to ADB's operations in Viet Nam and by avoiding duplication of the World Bank's work on social and environmental safeguards;

(d) a program to be implemented over a short period should not have outcome performance targets that require complex economic, legal, and institutional reforms; and

(e) having a separate PRSC coordination unit (with full-time staff) at the State Bank of Viet Nam and PRSC focal points at other relevant government agencies is a more effective implementation arrangement for the PRSC process on the Government's side than utilizing a PRSC secretariat that comprises senior government officials but lacks full-time staff.",Viet Nam: Support the Implementation of Poverty Reduction Program III,38392-033,"ADB is supporting a multi-donor program to reduce poverty in Viet Nam.

These are summarized here.

Delays were generally due to weak project management and limited assets of the contractors; design changes; cash flow problems associated with availability of counterpart funds; and limited understanding of ADB procedures and requirements by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), particularly regarding resettlement.

Some of the lessons are obvious. For example, prequalification of contractors should be conducted more carefully to ensure that only qualified contractors with the required capacity are awarded contracts. ADB should continue to make every effort to ensure that MPWT staff are familiar with ADB procedures and requirements before the start of a project. It is noted that efforts have been initiated by ADB recently, and it is expected that they will bear results in the future.

Designs are often changed during implementation of a civil works project. This Project was no exception, but the faulty design of the roads in hilly terrain should not have been accepted by ADB.

On the other hand, technology transfer is an essential part of development. Thus, there is a need, in project formulation, to balance the use of consultants with the capabilities of the EA.

Fewer approval steps for procurement helps with timely implementation of projects. The full financial authority exercised by the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) and Dhaka Electric Supply Company (DESCO) helped accelerate project implementation.

A gradual approach to reform is most appropriate for a complex, integrated power sector, such as in Bangladesh.

However, since project implementation, approaches to similar projects have evolved in both ADB and India. In ADB, the sector program approach with accompanying technical assistance (TA) has become the general modality; while in India, financing of urban infrastructure through bond issues and general tax revenue has become more widespread. Hence, ADB should consider the lessons learned from the Project not only for future projects in India, but also in other developing member countries where urban institutions are less developed. For example, financing of large infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, and dams lend themselves to commercialization; while financing of smaller urban service projects such as water supply and sanitation (WSS) depend largely on local government capacity, tariff policy, and effective project design. These, in turn, require strengthening local government institutional and financial capacities to structure and implement sustainable projects.

The most notable are (a) the project design and implementation schedule should be detailed and logical to avoid confusion; (b) clear operating procedures and instructions relating to responsibilities and decision-making authority among all the parties concerned should be issued before project implementation; (c) sufficient time should be allowed for implementing a capacity-building project, particularly when the so-called 'new paradigm' of decentralization is to be established in a dynamic and still unsettled environment; (d) the roles and responsibilities of various offices and committees temporarily established for project implementation should be formally authorized to ensure they are able to fulfill their mandates without resistance from the established cadre; and (e) project implementation arrangements should be carefully prepared, as the large number of implementing institutions and corresponding project managers and technical teams for monitoring and guiding the consultants, made coordination more difficult.

Regarding the PCR's lessons), the task of supervising construction work is generally included in consultants' terms of reference. However, there are usually two reasons that consultants are unable to supervise these contractors properly, as in this Project: (a) the consultants are unqualified to do so; or (b) their person-months are inadequate to execute their terms of reference.

All have been largely covered in the preceding reviews of the Project, and all are reasonable. The Independent Evaluation Department (IED) has drawn the following main lessons.

(a) In the design of a project covering research, testing, demonstration, and farmer adoption,
the responsibilities of research-based agencies and extension services must be made clear. Realistic targets must be detailed in the project design as to adoption by farmers directly as a result of project intervention and wider-scale adoption supported by the extension services, drawing on the demonstration activities of the research agencies.

(b) Applied research should take realistic account of the environment within which technology packages will be applied. There is little point in expending effort on packages requiring levels of extension, infrastructure, financial, and marketing services that are not generally found. In this same context, ADB must be clearer in directing its support and in distinguishing between research and extension activities; the proposal made at the Management Review Meeting that the Project should take a phased approach might have merited more favorable consideration.

(c) The interface between research, testing, demonstration, and the extension services must
be built into project design. Problems encountered in the Project might have been averted if a more phased approach had been adopted, as suggested at the Management Review Meeting.

At a more general level, the Project had four components, 12 subcomponents, and 76 performance targets (effectively activities). Several targets were poorly differentiated, and the Project was highly prescriptive, leaving little flexibility during implementation. Perhaps guidelines would have helped in designing subprojects, in which there is adequate detail to ensure that goals and outcomes are met without excessive prescription.

Moreover, although there were positive indications that the Project carried out an adequate monitoring and evaluation system, its design, implementation, and utilization was not well described.

(b) Careful preparation of interventions should aim to prevent sequencing problems. In this context, the timing of corporate governance reforms should be coordinated with financial sector and judicial reforms, because they are interlinked.

(c) Building capacity for reforms in state agencies requires competitive wages to be paid to experts employed by these agencies. If competitive salaries cannot be sustained beyond the project period, the type of capacity building supported under the Project cannot be sustainable.

1. The early processing of the loan and the success with respect to meeting the loan covenants demonstrate the importance of investing time in loan processing and setting tough conditions for loan approval.

2. The Program could have included a mechanism of formal review after about 18 months in order to consider revising the content and timing of loan covenants. The objective would be to make the covenants more relevant to prevailing conditions, strengthen or bring forward some conditions, and waive or defer others.

3. A well-thought-out structure for implementing the Energy Sector Restructuring Program (ESRP) monitoring was established. The loans for the ESRP were closely coordinated with those of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other development partners, particularly the World Bank. This close coordination was a key strength in successful implementation of the ESRP.

4. If ADB attaches great importance to similar analysis, it should consider ensuring that commitment to undertake the analysis is irrevocable, for example, by making the work a loan condition and carrying out preliminary work before loan approval.

5. Where possible, ADB should link its loan conditions to aspects of the Program where it has strongly positioned itself in the policy dialogue and should take a leadership role in the financing partnership.

6. Difficult lending conditions like the requirement to privatize Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) are achievable, but ADB (and the executing agency or EA) must be prepared to persevere over a long period and extensive support must be provided through technical assistance and policy guidance.",,32146-013,,http://www.adb.org/projects/32146-013/main#project-pds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,4740,6f4gw

Uzbekistan: Small and Medium Enterprise Development Project,,http://www.adb.org/documents/uzbekistan-small-and-medium-enterprise-development-project,31-05-09,,Uzbekistan,,Validation of Project/Program Completion Report,,PVR Partly/less than successful,,,,,,"The project completion report (PCR) included a number of lessons, including the need for accompanying credit lines with policy dialogue on real sector reforms and covenants that ensure sound and autonomous credit policies and practices by participating commercial banks (PCBs). Lessons identified by the Independent Evaluation Department (IED) in conjunction with this Project reconfirm earlier IED findings on ADB projects using state banks as financial intermediaries, which have been largely negative. State banks, particularly those operating in interventionist economic systems, are often used for non-commercial purposes, which reduces their incentives and capacity for adequate risk assessment and management. In the absence of meaningful financial sector reforms in Uzbekistan to strengthen the commercial orientation of the PCBs, ADB's use of the financial intermediation lending (FIL) modality was inappropriate.

Even in a more conducive policy environment and in light of their limited experience with longer-term small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending, the three PCBs should have received assistance prior to the approval of the Project and during implementation to help build their credit risk assessment and management capabilities and assist directly in the appraisal of subprojects. Given the rather fluid situation of the banking sector, ADB's inexperience in dealing with most of the PCBs, and a lack of access to reliable information regarding their financial condition, TA and loan proceeds should have been allocated on a first come- first served basis and taken into consideration the PCBs' actual financial and operational performance instead of pre-determining maximum loan amounts for each PCB.

ADB should have suspended loan utilization when covenants were not being complied with.

In addition, the PCR recommended the inclusion of covenants requiring the PCBs to monitor the financial condition of sub-borrowers on a quarterly basis. While appropriate under other circumstances, it is doubtful that such a requirement would have made a difference in enabling banks to proactively identify potential repayment problems, given SME accounting systems and the limited predictive value of financial statements in Uzbekistan. Regular site visits would have been a more appropriate tool under these conditions.",Uzbekistan: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) Development,31575-013,,http://www.adb.org/projects/31575-013/main#project-pds,Industry and Trade,,,,,,Small and medium enterprise development,,Economic affairs management,,,,Inclusive Economic Growth,,,,Private Sector Development and Private Sector Operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,5843,jeaia

The PCR says that the requirement for the cross-border agreement (CBA) to be adopted delayed loan effectiveness. This may be so, but it proved to be a very effective tool in encouraging its adoption. The process took less than 1 year, which seems rather remarkable given bureaucratic inertia against accepting major changes to existing practices. Procurement need not have been delayed by as much as it was if advance procurement had been allowed.

The PCR correctly points out the danger of using appraisal estimates of road conditions, which should not be considered as fixed when estimating project costs. Almost all projects experience delays of some sort, while the road continues to deteriorate. The assumption that governments will maintain a road in its current condition is nai?ve because governments see little point in spending funds, except for emergency repairs, on something that will soon be reconstructed. Generally they prefer to use such funds for other maintenance or to fund the upcoming project. The PCR suggests that 'to ensure that existing facilities are kept maintained by the client country until the mobilization of works, an adequate provision for maintenance may be considered as a condition for loan approval by ADB.' To make an allocation is easy, but the actual release of funds for such purposes is not guaranteed. Reality dictates that the appraisal estimates must reflect a realistic estimate of what will be needed to meet project goals. Alternatively, as in this case, the government may agree to pay the additional costs.

The PCR makes an important suggestion and that is simply that 'ADB should design a standard, user-friendly reporting template containing all required details' for project progress reports. This would significantly improve ADB's review, reporting, and monitoring activities.",Kazakhstan: Almaty-Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation,29568-013,,http://www.adb.org/projects/29568-013/main#project-pds,Transport,,,,,,,,,Road transport (non-urban),,,"Inclusive Economic Growth, Regional Integration",,,,"Private Sector Development and Private Sector Operations, Governance and Capacity Development, Gender Equity and Mainstreaming",,,Some gender elements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,4675,836x

(a) Cooperation and commitment of the central government and its ministries are necessary to devolve power to regional institutions to carry out a successful decentralization program for regional development.

In this regard, the option to use an existing institution such as the Ministry of Atoll Development (MOAD) to carry out the Project should have been investigated instead of creating new ones like the two regional development management offices (RDMOs) for that purpose. Because they were outside the accepted bureaucracy, they encountered problems pertaining to empowerment, coordination, and operations that hindered their performance.

The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) concurs with these lessons. In addition, it is considered that in a country such as Papua New Guinea (PNG), more weight needs to be placed during design and implementation the pressures that face enterprises in PNG due to land ownership, tribal conflict, compensation and the difficult socio-cultural and logistical environment.

A further lesson, which appears to apply to many less successful ADB projects, is that adequate institutional analysis during design is essential followed by selection of the right institutional arrangements, if institutional problems during implementation are to be minimized. OED further considers that the experience with the Technical Assistance Screening and Management Unit (TASMU) highlights the potential problems of establishing a new institution for project implementation. In this case, inexperienced and sometimes inappropriate staff were appointed to the unit.

Philippines: Grains Sector Development Program,,http://www.adb.org/documents/philippines-grains-sector-development-program,31-08-08,,Philippines,,Validation of Project/Program Completion Report,,PVR Unsuccessful,,,,,,"The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) considers that the lessons identified by the project completion report (PCR) are valuable, and merit detailed consideration by ADB.

A further lesson which can be drawn is that program loans providing budget support may become less of an incentive if fiscal conditions in a country improve after program design or loan effectiveness. In this context, particular care may be required in promoting program loans during periods of fiscal constraint, in case demand for the funds declines as conditions improve. Additional effort to promote policy objectives may also be necessary if the Government, in a recipient country, changes prior to program loan completion.

OED considers that in the case of the Grains Sector Development Program (GSDP), the local funding commitment of $55 million was likely to have been well beyond the capacity of the Government in a fiscally constrained period. Consideration could be given in such circumstances to increasing local cost financing of the investment loan, particularly in the first 2 years, and, if necessary, reducing the amount of the policy loan. OED also considers that ADB needs to be fully cognizant of external factors (such as a change of government), and needs to take necessary steps to counteract resulting issues; in the case of the GSDP, for example, by considering the post-facto decoupling of some of the policy conditions.

GSDP experience reinforces the statement in the ADB Operations Manual that 'strong commitment to sector reform by the government is essential for the success of the sector development program (SDP) modality of lending.'

(a) The provision of free house wiring kits by the Project to some customers (identified as poor households) and not others has only been unsuccessful for two reasons. More socially acceptable mechanisms for helping poor households to install internal house wiring should be examined for future projects.

(b) Apparently the whereabouts of about 24 solar panels (out of 100) were not known at the time
of the ADB Project Completion Review Mission. Any future projects that include the provision of solar panel lighting systems should be designed so that (i) appropriate beneficiaries are targeted, (ii) installation activities are recorded and monitored to ensure that the systems are correctly installed and operational at the end of the project, and (iii) processes are designed and implemented to ensure that the Project is sustainable and that systems are properly maintained over time.

A third lesson to be learned relates to the design of electrical distribution projects.

(c) Considering the number of distribution systems that ADB has financed and designed over the years, errors of more than 100% in estimating the electricity demand (132 kWh per month per household design versus 49 kWh per month per household actual) and an underrun of 30% on the unit cost of solar panels ($1,454 actual versus $2,080 estimated at appraisal) are not

The majority of the ADB loan was canceled and the project scope was reduced from $20 million to $5 million.

The PCR states that prequalification standards have been strengthened to avoid such situations in the future, and this is a good response to an important lesson. This validation suggests the following lesson in addition to those listed in the PCR. Most projects of this type have overly optimistic implementation schedules. In the case of this Project, the executing agency (EA) had plenty of time to undertake the preconstruction phase, because loans to India were not being approved until about 2 years after appraisal.

(i) An in-depth institutional analysis at all levels of project implementation by the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) team is necessary so that appropriate and effective capacity building provisions are made in the project design.

(ii) Realistic assumptions based on past experience (or plausibly changed circumstances) are necessary in making provision for counterpart funding in project design taking into account the economic conditions of the country, province, district and local communities.

(iii) Preparation and approval of new legislation is outside the control of a project, and hence, such requirements should not be a precondition for loan effectiveness. However, if this is essential for the success of an investment project, it would make sense for this to be a precondition for processing.

(iv) Meaningful benefits can be realized by recruiting and fielding consultants shortly after commencement of a project. This may require advance procurement of consulting services, if necessary.

(ii) For more efficient implementation, it is advisable to concentrate on a specific geographic area rather than to pursue a scattered, large project.

(iii) Long delays between design and actual construction often necessitate major modifications in the engineering designs, thus causing further delays. A related issue is the relevance and completeness of the designs.

(iv) Project implementation arrangements would be more efficient if the project management office were provided with the authority needed to undertake procurement, supplemental agreements, and contract variations.

(v) To avoid misuse of project vehicles, the possibility of renting or leasing these vehicles could be studied as a means of ensuring proper use and accountability.

First, the design of the Project was based on the project approach, but during implementation many aspects of the sector approach were used. One consequence of this is the expensive redesign costs, as conditions between the design and the start of civil works can change. During construction, designs have to be changed. Using a sector approach during project preparation could provide the executing agency (EA) with a broader picture of the entire network and provide flexibility in certain agreed-upon parameters, thus reducing the need for ADB approval for every minor or significant change. (Using a sector approach does not necessitate using sector loans. The idea of using the sector approach at the preparation stage is to step out of the narrow confines of the project and look at the broader picture of network management. This approach could enable better sustainability of the project roads funded under ADB loans.) Second, realistic implementation schedules should be prepared during appraisal.

(i) ADB needs to ensure adequate project preparation, particularly for novel areas of ADB country operations, which could result in implementation issues, as well as time and cost overruns.

(ii) ADB oversight should act flexibly and proactively to address planning deficiencies identified during project implementation. This highlights the importance of real-time feedback within the same regional department and operational division on implementation issues, especially for similar projects or phased projects being implemented on overlapping basis.

(iii) Frequency and high-quality ADB supervision missions, as well as continuity in ADB staff appreciation and approach, contributes to project success.

(iv) ADB still needs to add more value by bringing in innovative practices and ideas for improving the road network and institution capacity.

(v) Integrating a key national highway (NH) with nearby local road networks is beneficial as the connection maximizes development impacts by strengthening local development.

(vi) Rigorous attention is needed to elucidate project impacts, outcomes, and outputs in terms of quantified targets and indicators that can be monitored. This will establish a clear basis for evaluating social and economic impacts.

This validation agrees with the one lesson, which is:

(i) In implementing a program of power sector reforms, thorough policy research and design, along with adequate assessment of the constitutional and legal constraints, should be ensured
at the time of program formulation.

The second lesson from the PCR is stated as:

(ii) As the technical assistance (TA) loan was formulated prior to adoption of the New Electricity Law, some of its components had to be adjusted, delayed, or even cancelled. With hindsight, the TA loan should have been provided after enactment of the new Electricity Law so as to provide targeted support to implementation of the law. In this validation, the problem vis-a?-vis the new Electricity Law was not to provide targeted support but rather to address risks carefully. And the designers did consider the risks carefully but this particular risk of annulment was not identified. In project scheduling one cannot always wait until all risks are identified before proceeding with implementation. Therefore the lesson that the designers did address but to be reinforced is to address risks carefully in Project design.

This validation would add two further lessons.

(iii) The basis of the design of capacity building projects should be included in the appraisal for capacity building projects and reported in the reports and recommendations of the president (RRPs) and PCRs, particularly to show relevance.

(iv) All of the outcomes and outputs should be identified in the RRP, in the design and in the PCR, to keep the Project focused and to monitor and evaluate achievements.",,31604-023,,http://www.adb.org/projects/31604-023/main#project-pds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01-01-70 0:00,01-01-70 0:00,andrequintos,,0,202.4.3.26,4645,1jezd
