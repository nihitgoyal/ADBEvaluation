A more effective, high-level coordinating body needs to be established for a complex project of this nature, which comprised various groups of outputs. This could help regularly monitor a project's implementation progress. Planning and coordinating preliminary activities must be done well to minimize delays, including the use of advance actions. Sufficient consultation during project preparation should be undertaken in light of the CHC's (Customs House of Chittagong) decision during implementation not to use ADB funds for their automation program.

This validation offers a few lessons. During project implementation, constant follow-up is needed on the operationalization of the PPMS (project performance management system) and the conduct of baseline and other survey/data collection requirements that could be used in the PCR's (project completion report's) preparation. Likewise, the membership in the project coordination committee could have included a representative of the CCC (Chittagong City Corporation).

For a project with interrelated components funded from separate sources, it is important that a coordination mechanism is set in place to integrate and optimize outputs and impacts. For example, coordination between the ADB-funded components 1 and 2, and the Global Environment Fund-funded, United Nations Development Programme-administered component 3 was lacking in the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project in Cambodia. While the its design was well conceived with three separate but interrelated components, parallel financing arrangements and the creation of a separate Tonle Sap Conservation Project appear to have made it difficult to coordinate and integrate the project components. ADB's internal procedures somehow reinforced the notion that these were two separate projects. In addition, the project completion report team did not have complete information on the activities and disbursements of component 3. [Main text, paras. 26, 29]

This validation offers three additional lessons. First, before implementing any additional works or contract variation, there should already be agreement on the works to be done and the commensurate costs. While this is an accepted project management practice, it may not have been the case in this project, which resulted in significant delays in loan closing due to the negotiations on pricing for additional works or variations. Second, while work on the land acquisition and resettlement seemed to have progressed well, the executing agency - the WYRC (West Yunnan Railway Company) - should have been provided more assistance in its implementation given its inexperience with both PRC (People's Republic of China) and ADB practices. As such, ADB assistance, through more frequent missions during the implementation period, could have provided the guidance needed for land acquisition and resettlement. A third lesson was the need to constantly follow-up with the executing agency on the implementation of the PPMS (project performance and monitoring system). It is surprising to note that this loan condition was not readily achieved, although its compliance was considered as ongoing.

Western Transport Corridor Project: Validation of Completion Report,India,Transport,01-08-14,"The PCR (project completion report) identified a few important lessons from the experience with contractors. The criteria for the qualification of contractors under a joint venture and for the award of multiple contracts should be strengthened. The PCR did not elaborate how this can be accomplished. This needs to be further assessed to formulate concrete steps to ensure that prequalified contractors are indeed capable as claimed and have the technical and financial resources to complete the proposed project. While performance bond requirements seek to guarantee contractor performance, this seemed ineffective under this project. There is also a need to strengthen provisions related to contractors' performance, such as mobilization, staffing, deployment of equipment and funds, release of payments, bonus for early completion, and penalties so that poor contractor performance could be discouraged. Likewise, the performance of the contractor should be assessed at the initial stages of the contract and the decision on termination, if warranted, should not be delayed.

Participatory Irrigation Sector Project: Validation of Completion Report,Indonesia,"Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development",10-02-15,"The PCR (project completion report) identified a number of lessons derived from the implementation of the project. While all of these are appropriate, this validation highlights mainly two of these as they have wide applicability across developing countries and within ADB. The first lesson deals with the reinforced conviction that WUA (water users association) and/or WUAF (water users associations' federation)-guided participatory irrigation management can be successfully implemented at the district level and in the lower levels in developing countries. The participation of farmers in these schemes improved project implementation as compared to the situation when there was exclusive reliance on administrators and contractors. The second lesson relates to the need to avoid overwrought arrangement for project disbursements. In this project, prorated financing arrangements from three different fund sources across each category of expenditure constrained the flow of funds. The size of imprest accounts should also be large enough to provide adequate cash flow for the executing agencies to operate while disbursement applications are being processed. This is particularly applicable for sector projects.

CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Zhambyl Oblast Section) Investment Program - Tranche 1: Validation of Completion Report,Kazakhstan,Transport,10-02-15,"The PCR (project completion report) identified three lessons. The first lesson was the need for realistic cost estimates. To avoid loan cancellations, effective due diligence should be undertaken through detailed engineering studies, examination of market rates of construction materials and consultant remuneration, and inclusion of careful calculations of physical and price contingencies in the project cost estimate. The second was the need for clearly identifying the role of the project management consultant. The original terms of reference did not properly define the tasks and deliverables of each expert and considerable time for refinements was needed. The third was the need to improve the executing agency's project management capacity. Inadequate knowledge and expertise of MOTC (Ministry of Transport and Communications) and the Committee for Roads on safeguards and procurement affected smooth project implementation. This validation supports these lessons. In addition, the validation notes traffic forecasts should be much more realistic, and reflect impacts of follow on projects on expected usage. Similarly, more effort should be taken to establish sustainable asset management systems, supported by credible sources of funding.

Second, to attract investments, Kyrgyz Republic firms should also strengthen their productive capabilities and improve their competitiveness. Third, the significant changes in the methodology of the 2015 Doing Business report have negatively affected the Kyrgyz Republic's overall position in the ranking, making it difficult to measure achievements against the program's initial target. However, this validation notes that the Global Competitiveness Report can provide a good alternative source of information on the country's overall competitiveness. And last, the PCR indicated that the report's usefulness lies more in monitoring the country's performance over time rather than measuring progress against other economies.

There are clear benefits to involving ADB resident missions in project supervision.These include closer (hands-on) involvement and better understanding of the local environment. In the case of the Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project in Kyrgyz Republic, significant disbursement delays were reported prior to 2005. The situation improved after the Kyrgyz resident mission began screening withdrawal applications. In 2007, ADB transferred responsibility for project administration from ADB headquarters to the resident mission.

2. To adequately apprise ADB of the severity of project problems, projects may require (i) in-depth analysis by missions, and (ii) a established mechanism for consultants to prepare realistic reports to project management units (PMUs) and ADB. In the case of the Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project in the Kyrgyz Republic, project documents revealed that in the early years of the project, the PMU or consultants did not adequately apprise review missions on the seriousness of the project's problems (e.g., 45 subprojects had unsatisfactory performance due to problems relating mainly to poor design, construction, and operation and maintenance).

Kyrgyz Republic: Emergency Rehabilitation Project [Loan 2045-KGZ],Kyrgyz Republic,"Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development, Education, Energy, Transport",31-12-10,"1. Emergency projects such as this one tend to be difficult to administer and implement and difficult for ADB to properly guide and oversee. This is because speed is of the essence to restore normal activity, and subprojects tend to be spread over large geographical areas. As such, ADB has to depend not only on review mission diligence but also on consultants and the government agencies involved. ADB's procedures, while fully adequate for non-emergency projects, tend to slow the implementation of emergency projects such as this one, so due diligence is sometimes truncated. As a result, subprojects were undertaken that do not meet requirements or necessary approvals. The social infrastructure projects under this project are cases in point. Prior to due diligence approval, works were undertaken and retro-financed after due diligence approval. Also, three of the new schools, while probably needed, did not meet subproject selection criteria. ADB may wish to review its procedures for such projects so that such compromising activities can be avoided. [Main text, page 9, section E(ii)]

Basic Education Sector Development Program: Validation of Completion Report,Lao PDR,Education,24-12-15,"Three important lessons were identified in the PCR (program completion report) and this validation acknowledges them as important. In particular, taking a sector-wide approach to sector development with implementation support that is closely linked to and complements policy reform is important. It is clearly essential to ensure that there is close alignment of the content of the RRP (report and recommendation of the President) and the explicit outcomes and outputs in the DMF (design and monitoring framework). This validation notes that there were a number of inconsistencies in the RRP.
project cycle stage: Concept, Implementation

There was clearly strong coordination and strategic dialogue among all stakeholders in this program. This appears to have been a strong feature of the BESDP (Basic Education Sector Development Program) implementation effort with the executing agency, consultants, and ADB freely interacting and discussing issues that allowed some recovery from initial delays.
project cycle stage: Implementation

There was value gained by engaging MOES (Ministry of Education and Sports) units as implementing partners to help build institutional capacity and ensure sustainability at post-project. This is often discussed in the design of development aid programs but is rarely evident in the final implementation. In this program, the careful identification of responsibilities and division of labor, clear unit and individual accountability, and sustained monitoring were critical to its success.
project cycle stage: Design, Implementation, Operation

It is essential that the DMF (design and monitoring framework) in the RRP (report and recommendation of the President) accurately presents the outcomes, outputs, and indicators that will be used to evaluate the performance of the program.

Lao People's Democratic Republic: Banking Sector Reform Program,Lao PDR,Finance,31-10-11,"1. To improve the success of policy reform interventions, there is a need to ensure that executing and implementing institutions have adequate capacities in terms of staff and skills to supervise the implementation and operationalization of the reforms. For example, the Bank of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) under the Banking Sector Reform Program in Lao PDR could have rigorously supervised and controlled the banking system had it acquired adequate capacity to do so. Its lack of capacity still partly explain the continuing weak financial positions and nonperforming loans of state-owned commercial banks in Lao PDR. [Main text, paras. 14, 19]

Also, given limited resources, sector selectivity is important to ensure a significant impact. Moreover, emergency project designs should likewise incorporate provisions for operation and maintenance of project facilities to ensure their sustainability. [Main text, para. 30]

Very often proponents from the central government have a different concept of needs and priorities from agencies at the field or local level. Local involvement in project conceptualization ensures greater success, as there would be better ownership of its components and a more accurate identification of the needs of intended beneficiaries. Additional gains will be made through greater commitment for sustained operation and maintenance and more accurate assessment of willingness to borrow. [Main text, para. 22]

There is a need to lay down a firm legal, regulatory, and supervisory foundation prior to embarking on promotion of financing institutions, such as savings and credit cooperatives (SCCs). In this case, ADB attempted to establish the regulatory structure in parallel to project implementation, which did not work well. The two activities should have been better prepared, and sequenced as separate projects. The regulatory structure should have been supported by a comprehensive technical assistance with adequate resources to prepare and promote the legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework, to have it passed by the legislature, and to ensure adequate institutional capacity to execute that framework. With the regulatory structure in place, the implementation should have proceeded with components for training, promotion, and institution development of SCCs. That approach would have had better prospects for success in establishing a sustainable rural finance system. [Main text, page 6, section E(ii.a)]

The implementation of the program highlighted the appropriateness of the cluster program modality for sustaining reform momentum. Greater effort is needed in assessing the political and economic context to determine the chances of success of reform efforts. The program design was complex with 25 policy conditions for subprogram 1 and 38 policy conditions for subprogram 2, involving a large number of implementing agencies and reform areas. There are benefits in keeping program simple by limiting the number of reform actions, agencies involved, and the number of subprograms under a cluster. This validation shares the view of the PCR that the decision to cancel the processing of subprogram 3 could have been accompanied with efforts to identify reform areas that were making progress and to support these with TA (technical assistance) or with resources on existing or new projects.

While it is important to correctly and objectively assess implementation constraints and implementation capacity, countries with serious development needs and weak institutional capacity should be assisted with building up this capacity as part of project design. This refers to short-term project implementation capacity as well as to longer-term program administration capacity. The project starting date should be set after start-up TA has been successfully completed, and countries with weak institutional capacity should be given time to comply with the covenants and requirements for loan effectiveness through a mentoring process that the start-up TA should provide.

In such situations, ADB may in the future consider redesign to align the project with the needs for disaster recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction, meshed with assistance from other development partners. In the project, it may have been possible to effectively reorient the project to focus on reconstructing hospitals and schools in the affected districts or other aspects as decided by the government.

The risks associated with a change in scope (in this case the inadequate capacity of the executing/implementing institution) needs to be fully considered to prevent project failure. For example, experience with the Financial Management Project in Papua New Guinea (PNG) pointed to the importance of ensuring that institutional capacity exists carrying out changes, i.e., technical aspects of the project design. The decision to combine components 1 and 2 during its third year of implementation, and to fund the development of an integrated software package that could cover all activities under these two components introduced a huge risk to the project. The use of an integrated system for public sector financial management was rare even in developed countries, and required technical sophistication in the development and operations phase that was nonexistent in PNG. This change in design led to implementation delays, and adversely affected project outputs and outcomes. It also reduced the relevance of the project. [Main text, paras. 10, 20]

To identify potential sector programming issues, ADB needs to actively engage with other development partners' on their investment plans prior to or in the early stage of loan implementation and match its own comparative advantage in offering assistance to a DMC. In the case of the Angat Water Utilization and Aqueduct Improvement Project in the Philippines where, instead of pursuing the ADB multitranche financing facility, the government opted for a loan from the Government of the People's Republic of China. The government deal with many official development assistance partners, and there are grants and loans with better conditions than ADB loans. While the project team insists that the government decision to change its funding source was unexpected, through project documents, the validation report did not find significant evidence suggesting that ADB actively explored other development partners' investment plans in the sector, prior to or in the early stage of the loan implementation, nor did it assess its own comparative advantage in offering its assistance to the Philippine development assistance environment in the water sector. A master plan for water resource development in each river basin including careful assessment of conflicting responsibilities for regulation, extraction, and approval in the sector is needed for future ADB engagement.

Under the Small Business Development Project in Samoa, the latter does not appear to have been done  on one of its components, Venture Capital Fund (VCF). The report and recommendation of the president was more of a description of what the proposed VCF would look like. Many loose ends, including critical issues such as shareholder contributions, choice of the fund manager and key staff, and tax liability, were left to be sorted out during implementation which took time for resolution, and the VCF was closed without doing any business after determining that it was unlikely to be financially viable.

In the case of countries with potential debt service payment risks, incorporating a debt sustainability analysis in the risk and vulnerability assessment of the project can help anticipate the potential risks to ADB. In the Post-conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project, the country's severe budgetary constraint in early 2000 meant the government will be unable to finance any reconstruction work in the short term. ADB could have identified this potential debt payment issue by doing a simple debt sustainability analysis and instituted necessary mitigation measures to avoid 3-year delay in project implementation.

Sustainable Cotton Subsector Project: Validation of Completion Report,Tajikistan,"Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development, Finance",16-01-15,"This validation subscribes to the major lessons the PCR (project completion report) drew out for ADB operations. The PCR noted that the project's amended purpose and objectives, as well as the corresponding outputs needed to meet them, were clearly stated. At the same time, the PCR noted that many operational and management lapses could have been immediately and effectively averted if the executing agencies had a better appreciation of the processes, procedures, and requirements of the project and helped ensure government's commitment to project objectives. Baseline data and monitoring reports were not complied with. Required contractual agreements were only halfheartedly pursued. Clearly, the implementing institutions' earlier and closer guidance on the processes and procedures for procuring goods and services, and the timely selection of private partners could have avoided implementation slippage. Due diligence on the capacity and commitment of government partner institutions, like the MOA (Ministry of Agriculture), to implement components assigned to them should have been undertaken at appraisal to determine the risks and sustainability of involving them.

Tajikistan: Health Sector Reform Project,Tajikistan,Health,10-12-12,"Relative success of the project was facilitated by: (i) Installation of project management at a very high level with the President's office as executing agency and the deputy prime minister as project coordinator. With such high level management support, the adoption of key policy recommendations and implementation of essential reform packages had a much better chance of being acted upon more quickly than if it were anchored on a weak ministry that still needed reform and strengthening.; and (ii) ADB's having frequent review missions at the initial stage, active participation in technical discussions, and prompt action on project requests, were critical factors in ensuring that the project remained responsive to recurrent and emerging needs and that implementation was on track with the project timelines.

For lessons to be useful during project implementation, they need to be taken into account during the formulation and design stage. Listing lessons learned in the report and recommendation of the President is not enough. For example, the implementation of the Power Rehabilitation Project in Tajikistan would have benefited if at least some of the past  lessons were taken into account during its formulation and design. Many of the implementation problems arose because of the executing agency's (Barki Tajik) unfamiliarity with ADB's procurement procedures, and the appraisal mission was well aware that such unfamiliarity has delayed the start of many projects in Central Asia. These problems would have been avoided had this been taken into account in  the project's design and the executing agency provided the necessary familiarization training on ADB procurement procedures.

Success of reforms largely depend on support by recruited champions from all stakeholder groups  (including the upper levels of government) to a defined reform roadmap. In the case of the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project in Uzbekistan, donors were keen to free up agriculture, and while the government in principle agreed, it was nonetheless extremely cautious about reforms. The government continued to operate at its own pace, and was almost immune to international pressure, which affected the achievement of reforms. [Main text, para. 25]

2. In establishing viable private agricultural services institutions in transition economy, it is important that the target farmers' willingness to avail of these services (in the short and long term) and their capacity to pay are assessed and considered during project design and implementation. Under the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project in Uzbekistan, the Rural Business Advisory Center (RBAC) and the Machinery and Tractor Pool (MTL) were intended to be self-sufficient by project end. This is unlikely to happen for the MTL as the institution's targeted small cash-strapped farmers are inherently the most challenged to make payments for availed services. Likewise, comments from target farmers indicate that demand for services from the RBAC are only confined during the early stages of the project.

The project's One Health concept emphasized the links between animal health and human health, and emerging animal and human diseases, which allowed a platform for unprecedented integration of animal, human, and ecosystem health issues to fight the threat of avian influenza. The systematic collaboration of technical agencies across disciplines, such as the FAO or Food and Agriculture Organization (veterinarians) and WHO or World Health Organization (medical doctors) and civil society organizations (community health workers), promoted this concept since the beginning of the project. ADB's financial and convening power and its high flexibility and responsiveness under the project helped build links and strengthen collaboration between WHO, the FAO, and the World Organization for Animal Health.

The urgent nature of the project due to the threat that avian influenza may become a pandemic, hampered the attempt in defining verifiable indicators for some outputs under the regional capacity building and regional coordination components.

This type of project faces the challenge of the early spread of the disease outpacing the gathering of scientific evidence essential in formulating containment policies.

This validation adds another lesson related to the relevance of design and formulation. Assessment of relevance includes both the relevance of objectives and the relevance of design. The adequacy and appropriateness of project design have to be tailored to the project's ultimate objectives and complexities.
