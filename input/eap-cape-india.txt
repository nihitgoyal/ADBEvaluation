A.         Introduction

1.     The purpose of the country assistance program evaluation (CAPE) is to provide the
Asian Development Bank's (ADB) Board of Directors and Management with an independent
assessment of past operational performance in India. This information will provide an input to
the design of the subsequent country partnership strategy (CPS). The CAPE will (i) provide an
independent assessment and rating of the performance of ADB's country programs and identify
factors affecting performance, and (ii) draw forward-looking lessons and make
recommendations for the next CPS of India.

2.      The proposed CAPE will be the second assessment of ADB's country strategies and
programs in India. The first CAPE was undertaken in 2007 and it assessed ADB support over
2 decades, from 1986 to 2006. A country partnership strategy final review (CPSFR) was
prepared in 2012 as self-assessment of the overall performance of ADB operations during the
CPS period (2009­2012). Independent Evaluation Department (IED) validated this CPSFR in
2013. 1 The proposed CAPE will follow on from the first CAPE and will cover 2007­2015.

3.     The proposed timing and implementation arrangements for the CAPE are determined by
and aligned to ADB's proposed schedule for developing its next CPS for India. The CAPE will
be guided by the principles and methodological approaches set out in the Revised Guidelines
for the Preparation of Country Assistance Program Evaluations and Country Partnership
Strategy Final Review Validations. 2 The revised guidelines reflect recent changes to ADB CPS
methodology and follow good practice standards for country-level evaluations by multilateral
development banks. As such, the revised guidelines should be read in conjunction with this
approach paper to gain a complete understanding of CAPE methodology as well as limitations.

B.         Background

4.     Economy. India is one of the world's largest economies, with a population of
1.267 billion 3 and its gross domestic product (GDP) in current prices at $2.1 trillion ranked
seventh in the world (based on nominal exchange rates). 4 India has experienced remarkable
economic growth since the early 1990s and while growth rates remain high by world standards,
they have declined over the past decade. While most of the FY2005-FY2010 period saw growth

averaging 9%, the rate declined to 5% in 2012 and 7% in 2013 and 2014. 5 One of the current
government's first steps after being elected was to initiate a range of reforms to restore growth.
A large number of reforms are underway, including reforms to the tax structure, notably the
introduction of goods and services tax, enabling environment improvements, better targeting of
subsidies, and improving capital expenditure.

5.      Poverty and diversity. The high economic growth that has occurred since the economic
reforms of the early 1990s has helped to reduce the poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (in
2011 international prices) from 46.1% in 1993 to 21.3 % in 2011. 6 This rapid growth and poverty
reduction was accompanied by a slight rise in inequality. 7 Thinking of India as one large country
may ignore the significant differences in size, demographics, culture, and climate of the various
states. The richer states have, on average, experienced relatively faster per capita GDP growth
and the pace at which richer states are pulling away from the poorer states appears to be
increasing, despite the strong performance of low income states. 8 As a result, poverty rates
range widely, from 5% in Goa to 40% in Chhattisgarh. 9 GDP per capita of the poorest state
Bihar was below $700 in 2014, while Goa and New Delhi achieved levels of above $4,500.

6.      Urbanization and environmental sustainability. Urbanization is progressing rapidly,
with the urban population forecast to grow from 31% (as of 2014) to 55% by 2050. 10 Rural India
continues to be an important target for development interventions, but investment in urban
centers, which contribute significantly to economic growth and activity, will require increasing
attention to address this demographic shift. A recent analysis on states, clusters, and cities
highlights the importance of urban districts in fuelling growth in India. 11 The urbanization rate of
each district is a key indicator of how fast its economy is growing, with an estimate that GDP per
capita of urban and semi-urban districts is four to five times that of rural districts. New migrants
to urban centers face numerous challenges including access to shelter, education, healthcare,
and basic amenities like water and sanitation. Ensuring that India's rapid urbanization is both
environmentally sustainable and inclusive and that its cities are efficient in terms of supporting
trade, investment, and business, is among the country's most significant challenges. 12

7.       Infrastructure challenges and public­private partnership. Government has
prioritized infrastructure development, particularly in transport and energy. Industrialization has
not taken off as envisaged in the lagging states, despite positive progress in economic
development. 13 Although demographic changes have been favorable, it has been difficult to use
this advantage due to infrastructure constraints that make it expensive to develop and run
manufacturing businesses. A low tax-to-GDP ratio, estimated at 7.2% in 2014 (footnote 6) is
one major constraint to securing sufficient funds to develop infrastructure. The government has

   In response to these challenges, the government has initiated three flagship urban missions: the Swachh Bharat
   (Clean India) Mission, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, and the Smart Cities Mission.

sought to increase investment in infrastructure by corporatization of public sector services and
scaling up public­private partnerships (PPPs).

C.       Government's Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012­2017

8.      The government's vision for development under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012­2017
was for "faster, sustainable, and more inclusive growth." The immediate challenge is to reverse
the observed deceleration in growth by reviving investment as quickly as possible. This calls for
urgent action to tackle implementation constraints in infrastructure which are holding up large
projects, combined with action to deal with tax related issues which have created uncertainty in
the investment climate. From a longer term perspective, the plan must put in place policies that
can leverage the many strengths of the economy to bring it back to its real growth potential. This
will take time but the aim is to get back to 9% growth by the end of the plan period. 14

9.       The plan identified a core set of indicators reflecting the vision of rapid, sustainable, and
more inclusive growth, for which all development partners can work, including not only the
central and state governments, but also local governments, civil society organizations, and
international agencies. 15 Under the plan, decentralization is likely to be facilitated by further
empowerment of states. The government has agreed to devolve a larger share of financial
resources to states. 16 For infrastructure, the issues of delays in clearances and financing gaps
are being addressed with a revitalized PPP model, higher outlays for roads and railways, and
regulatory reforms. The formation of a Monetary Policy Committee, the strengthening of the
regulatory mandate of the Securities and Exchange Board of India over the commodities
market, and the creation of a sector-neutral financial redressal agency which aims at consumer
protection by addressing grievances across all financial products and financial sector regulators
will likely lead to important financial reforms.

D.       Asian Development Bank's Country Strategies

10.    ADB's support to India during the evaluation period (2007­2014) was covered by a
country strategy and program update 2006­2008 17 and two CPSs covering the periods 2009­
2012 and 2013­2017. 18

   The following are the major indicators: (i) Economic Growth [(a) Real GDP Growth Rate of 8.0%, (b) Every State
   must have an average growth rate in the 12th plan preferably higher than that achieved in the 11th plan];
   (ii) Poverty and Employment [(a) Head-count ratio of consumption poverty to be reduced by 10 percentage points
   over the preceding estimates by the end of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, (b) Generate 50 million new work
   opportunities in the non-farm sector and provide skill certification to equivalent numbers during the Twelfth Five-
   Year Plan]; (iii) Infrastructure, including rural infrastructure [(a) Increase investment in infrastructure as a
   percentage of GDP to 9% by the end of Twelfth Five-Year Plan, (b) Provide electricity to all villages and reduce
   aggregate technical and commercial losses to 20% by the end of Twelfth Five-Year Plan, (c) Connect all villages
   with all-weather roads by the end of Twelfth Five Year Plan, (d) Ensure 50% of rural population has access to 40
   liters per capita per day piped drinking water supply]; (iv) Environment and Sustainability, [(a) Increase green cover
   (as measured by satellite imagery) by 1 million hectare every year during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, (b) Add
   30,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity in the 12th plan, (c) Reduce emission intensity of GDP in line with
   the target of 20% to 25% reduction over 2005 levels by 2020].

   The Finance Commission recommended the highest-ever devolution at 42% of center's total resources to state
   governments starting in 2015­2016.

           1.       Country Strategy and Program Update, 2006­2008

11.     The country strategy and program update, 2006­2008 kept the key objectives of the
ADB's country strategy and program approved in 2003, which aimed to mainstream poverty
reduction as the central organizing theme of ADB. The Government of India's Tenth Five-
Year Plan called for the urgent need to upgrade infrastructure facilities, and refocus on
agriculture and rural development so that growth became more broad-based and created
employment opportunities. In response, the relative size of infrastructure (transport, urban, and
energy) projects in ADB's program increased from 69% of the 2005­2007 pipeline as proposed
in the country strategy and program update, to 77% of the 2006­2008 pipeline. Although
infrastructure received most of ADB financial support, ADB kept a wide range of the pipeline in
infrastructure and non-infrastructure sectors, including transport, urban, energy, agriculture, and
water resource management, public resource management and governance, private and
financial sector development, education, and health.

           2.       Country Partnership Strategy, 2009­2012

12.     ADB's CPS 2009­2012 was aligned with India's Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007­2011)
and it drew from the recommendations of the 2007 CAPE for India. 19 ADB presented a strategy
that would support India's continued high growth rate, and make it more inclusive. The CPS had
four strategic pillars or objectives: (i) supporting inclusive and environmentally sustainable
growth, (ii) catalyzing investments through using innovative business and financing solutions,
(iii) strengthening results orientation and emphasizing knowledge solutions, and
(iv) supporting regional cooperation. This program involved (i) inclusion of lagging states
especially northeastern states in ADB operations, (ii) support to agriculture and water resource
management, and (iii) promotion of financial inclusion. 20 Over the CPS period (2009­2012),
ADB approved a sovereign lending program of $8.7 billion, comprising 80 investment projects.

           3.       Country Partnership Strategy, 2013­2017

13.      ADB's CPS for 2013­2017 (for about $10.04 billion) supports India's twelfth five-year
plan (2012­2017) priorities of "faster, more inclusive, and sustainable growth," creation of jobs
for youth, enhancement of ongoing investment reforms, and improvement of infrastructure in
critical areas. The strategy again combines physical investments with knowledge products to
address emerging issues of urbanization, water scarcity, and gives more prominence to newer
issues such as climate change, emission controls, internet connectivity, vocational training (to
address the problem of youth unemployment), and the development of capital markets (the lack
of which is a growing concern). Under the CPS, 2013­2017, ADB proposed to support the
government's vision of rapid, sustainable, and more inclusive growth.

14.     Below is a summary of the key objectives of the three ADB strategies which applied to
the 2007­2015 period to be evaluated. Table 1 shows that the key objectives in the ADB
strategies have evolved from a sector­oriented approach to more thematic-driven support.

      16.     By approved amounts, the transport and energy portfolios represented about 66% of the
      total portfolio during the evaluation period with 34% and 32%, respectively (Figure 1). The other
      major portfolios were water and other urban infrastructure and services (13%) and finance
      (10%). Multisector and public sector management operations made up 5% and 4% of approved
      amounts, respectively. Health and agriculture, natural resources, and rural development
      operations represented around 2% each while education operations took up 1%.

17.     Sovereign loans and grants. During the evaluation period, 115 sovereign loans and
grant amounting to $16.3 billion were approved. Six sovereign grants ($14.3 million in total)
were provided to the Government of India. Sovereign loans and grants represented about 84%
of the total ADB portfolio to India. The bulk of ADB sovereign operations were managed by
executing agencies in the national government and the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
Bihar, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh. The CAPE will provide a more detailed assessment of
sovereign operations by state and/or region.

18.    Multitranche financing facility. ADB introduced this instrument in mid-2005 and it was
mainstreamed in 2008. The multitranche financing facility (MFF) finances multiple projects
under an investment program in a sector or in several sectors, or large stand-alone projects with
substantial and related individual components with long-term implementation plans. The MFF
can also finance slices of long-term contract packages in such investment programs or large
stand-alone projects. The India program has been a major user of the MFF--36 out of 88 MFFs
approved in ADB for $13.86 billion. To date, these 36 MFFs have comprised of a total of 84
tranches. MFF is ADB's major financial modality for all sectors in India, except social sectors
and public sector management. About 60% of sovereign loans approved in the evaluation
period were financed by MFF. A list of India MFFs is provided in Appendix 2.

19.     Nonsovereign operations. ADB catalyzed private sector investments through direct
financing, credit enhancement, and risk mitigation instruments. Over 2007­2015, nonsovereign
operations represented 14% of the total ADB portfolio by approved amount. During this period,
ADB approved 48 nonsovereign investments amounting to $4.0 billion. The majority of the
nonsovereign investments focused on the energy (53%), finance (26%), and transport (17%)
sectors, although 15 of the 48 approved nonsovereign investments (31%) were cancelled.

20.    Technical assistance. ADB TA operations during the evaluation period represented
less than 1% of ADB's portfolio for India. On an annual basis, the average approved amount
from 2009 to 2014 24 was $16.7 million with a mode of close to $18 million (Appendix 1).

21.     Only a small proportion of the 315 projects approved during the 9-year evaluation period
have been completed and subjected to a project completion report (PCR), and a similar finding
applies to the 148 TA operations. Twelve PCRs were produced covering 14 sovereign loans 25
(out of 20 closed loans of the 109 total sovereign loans). The ratings were generally successful;
of the 12 PCRs, 9 were rated successful, 2 were rated highly successful, and 1 was rated less
than successful. Four of the PCRs were validated, all of which were rated successful. For the
nonsovereign operations, 4 extended annual review reports (XARRs) were completed, covering
7 nonsovereign investments (out of a total of 48 investments). The XARRs were all validated as
successful (one was rated highly successful). For the TA operations, a total of 33 technical
assistance completion reports (TCRs) were produced covering 34 TA operations (out of 148
total). Of the 33 TCRs, 26 were rated successful, 2 were rated highly successful, and 5 less
than successful. 26




24
   The period 2009­2014 was used for computing the average to remove the effects of outliers in 2007 and 2008.
25
   Fourteen sovereign loans supported 12 projects.
26
   As of 1 May 2012, IED changed the previous rating category of partly successful to less than successful to clarify
   that such a category indicates "below the line" performance. In this report, all prior ratings preceded by the word
   "partly" have been converted to the new designation of "less than."

           2.      Other Development Partners' Programs

22.      India is a significant recipient of official development funding. From 2007 to 2013, total
official development financial flows to India totaled $91 billion. Development funds from the
World Bank and ADB together made up more than 51% of these flows. This makes ADB one of
the three main development partners in India. The World Bank program for India covers a wide
range of sectors, with transport and energy being focus areas. The World Bank support is likely
to decline as International Development Association funds are phased out. Other significant
partners were Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, and the United States (Table 3).

23.      Support to BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and the People's Republic of China) countries
from a number of Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development donors may be cut or reduced in the near future. 27 In 2011, the
United Kingdom bilateral aid review indicated it would end bilateral aid programs in 16 countries
by 2016. 28 This may include India. The European Union has announced in its Multiannual
Financial Framework, 2014­2020, that it will end bilateral aid to 17 upper middle-income
countries, and two large low-income countries (India and Indonesia) with a combined GDP that
is larger than 1% of global GDP. In the FY2014 budget, it appeared that India was emerging as
a major aid donor with foreign aid expenditures that may reach $1.3 billion, more than its
expected foreign aid receipts.

           Evaluations

           1.      Country Assistance Program Evaluation 2007

24.     The 2007 CAPE for India covered two decades (1986­2006) of ADB operations, with an
overall rating of successful. While ADB's program may have been small relative to the size of
India's total public investment, ADB support made a significant contribution to the country's

development process. This support was most effective when it was focused, part of a long-term
engagement, and integrated with government reform initiatives. Support for infrastructure
development and policy reforms had an impact on economic growth which helped mitigate
income poverty. ADB's recent focus on rural development activities and the provision of basic
urban services are likely to have a positive impact on the reduction of both income and non-
income poverty, although there were concerns about sustainability that, if unaddressed, might
diminish impact. ADB was judged as having been not very effective in mainstreaming
environmental and gender objectives in its operations.

25.     To maximize impact with limited resources, the CAPE recommended that ADB
(i) improve strategic focus, (ii) improve the quality of its financial support, (iii) improve
nonlending services, (iv) increase private sector operations, and (v) increase responsiveness to
client concerns.

       2.     Country Partnership Strategy Final Review Validation, 2009­2012

26.    The CPSFR self-assessed the overall performance of ADB operations during the CPS
period (2009­2012) successful, based on satisfactory strategic positioning, a relevant program,
an effective and efficient delivery of outputs and expected outcomes, and a likely sustainable
and satisfactory development impact. The CPSFR validation report prepared by IED in 2013
confirmed the ratings of the CPSFR.

27.     The 2013 CPSFR validation report reviewed the implementation status of the earlier
CAPE recommendations and the findings of the 2011 CPSFR (footnote 1). The validation report
found that ADB registered satisfactory progress toward improving strategic focus, increasing
private sector support through PPPs, and increasing responsiveness to client concerns. The
2007 CAPE emphasized that ADB's policy inputs were important to reform lagging sector
policies (e.g., especially in fiscal management, power distribution, and urban development).
ADB's role of providing timely policy inputs and advice to a number of state governments has
become more significant over the 2009­2012 CPS period.

28.     ADB TA successfully introduced innovative knowledge solutions and international best
practices and procedures. Capacity development is required in several agencies working with
ADB. ADB operations are entering more difficult sectors (e.g., water and other municipal
infrastructure and services, and small industries), and ADB is operating in lagging states. The
CPSFR validation found that ADB needed to keep to building ADB's strong knowledge base and
expertise in core areas of support.

29.     The 2009­2012 CPS was largely public sector-oriented. ADB's CPS positioning should
have been more broad-based, understanding the role of the private sector in the country. The
validation recommended that ADB (i) strengthen policy dialogue and direct engagement with the
states, (ii) enhance synergies and impact by better linking outputs to outcomes, (iii) increase
staff resources in the field to engage better with lagging states and augment resources for
technical work to deliver innovative solutions and to stay abreast of client requirements,
(iv) prepare an integrated strategic framework to synergize ADB's public­private sector
operations, and (v) improve monitoring of the CPS results framework.

G.         Key Evaluation Issues 29

30.    As set out in the revised CAPE guidelines (footnote 2), the CAPE will assess the
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and development impacts of ADB's
operations in India. ADB and borrower performance will be assessed and issues, lessons, and
recommendations will be provided. Section H provides further details on the evaluation
methodology, criteria, and components. An evaluation framework is provided in Appendix 3.

31.    In assessing the ADB program using the above criteria, the following key issues and
questions will be addressed, given their importance to development in India and their
prominence in recent ADB CPSs for India and ADB's Strategy 2020.

32.     Inclusion and lagging states. ADB strengthened its inclusive development focus by
directing operations toward lagging states in the 2009 and 2013 CPSs. The CAPE will examine
how states were selected to address inclusive growth, what achievements were made in
promoting inclusive growth, and how ADB support in the lagging states has performed. In
addition, the shift to lagging states invokes other questions such as whether ADB appropriately
strengthened strategic programming discussions directly with state governments and how it
ensured project readiness and implementation capacity. State governments are the primary
agencies to implement development programs, and they differ significantly from each other,
necessitating development interventions to be locally adapted. In addition, project
implementation is challenging as many state and lower level bodies do not have exposure to or
familiarity with international standards, know-how, and best practices. This issue has become
particularly apparent as operations have entered more difficult sectors (e.g., water and other
municipal infrastructure and services).

33.     Environmentally sustainable growth. India, the world's third biggest greenhouse gas
emitter (8% of the world total), has pledged to generate 40% of its electricity from renewable
and other low-carbon sources by 2030. Environmental and climate impacts typically threaten the
poorest and most marginalized, and therefore the achievement of environmentally sustainable
growth will play a major role in achieving greater inclusion. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan 2012­
2017 set targets for environmentally sustainable growth as (i) increase green cover by 1 million
hectare every year during the plan, (ii) add 30,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity in
the plan, and (iii) reduce emission intensity of GDP in line with the target of 20%­25% reduction
over 2005 levels by 2020. Strategy 2020 introduced the strategic agenda of environmentally
sustainable growth in 2008, which included further strengthening climate change mitigation and
adaptation. The increasing significance of environmentally sustainable growth and climate
change related activities in ADB investments are expected to be reflected over the period of this
evaluation.

34.     Tackling greenhouse gas emissions can have the co-benefit of mitigating local air
pollution, now a critical human health challenge for many of India's cities. Poor water security is
a threat to the population and economy of India. Opportunities for green growth and low carbon
trajectories will need to be found to ensure that urban centers and key infrastructure sectors
contribute to India's development in an environmentally sustainable manner. The evaluation will
examine how ADB contributed to sustainable growth, including through its support for integrated,
resilient, and inclusive urban development, and whether ADB sufficiently integrated
considerations for environmental sustainability in its sector strategies and project designs.
29
     As set out in the revised CAPE guidelines (para. 22), additional evaluation issues/questions (above and beyond the
     standard evaluation criteria/questions) may need to be asked, depending on a country's unique context and
     circumstances.
                                                                                                                11



35.      Regional cooperation. ADB supported the South Asia Subregional Economic
Cooperation program, 30 and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and
Economic Cooperation. 31 A recent ADB regional cooperation initiative is the Bangladesh­
People's Republic of China­India­Myanmar Economic Corridor, which aims to establish a multi-
modal corridor between the four countries. The CPS for 2013­2017 emphasized that ADB
would facilitate the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program with emphasis on
lagging states and economic corridors. The CAPE will review how the synergy of the programs
was ensured and translated into the CPSs, and the effectiveness of regional cooperation efforts
overall.

36.     Knowledge solutions and innovation. The government initiated a Finance Plus
approach, where projects were made more effective by bringing new knowledge solutions,
practices, processes, and know-how. The 2009­2012 and 2013­2017 CPSs emphasized
knowledge solutions and aimed to build on innovations and best practices in the ADB programs.
Given the smallness of ADB's financial support relative to the large economy, knowledge
solutions and products should add value to ADB funding. Sector assessments will include an
analysis of how TA and other resources were used to support operations, capacity
development, and other objectives. The CAPE will review projects to gain lessons, and review
how ADB and the government shared knowledge and good practices among states, with a view
towards strengthening future support.

37.      Other issues. About 60% of sovereign loans approved in the evaluation period were
financed by the MFF (para. 18). The CAPE will assess how the modality added value, in
particular in the major infrastructure sectors where it is now the predominant financing modality
and how objectives of MFFs whose timeframes stretch longer than a CPS period are relevant to
the country and sector strategies. The private sector's role in India's economic development is
growing fast and becoming more diverse. ADB approved $4.0 billion in private sector financing,
although a significant proportion was subsequently cancelled. The evaluation will examine how
ADB's nonsovereign operations performed, how it coordinated its sovereign and nonsovereign
operations, and how better collaboration between sovereign and nonsovereign operations can
be ensured to create greater impact from its support. The CAPE will review ADB's efforts to
promote gender equality and women's empowerment through improved gender analysis and
action plans, monitoring of key gender equality outcomes, and documenting gender equality
results.

H.      Evaluation Methodology: Framework and Limitations

38.    The CAPE will cover the period 2007­2015 and adhere to the principles and
methodological approach in the CAPE guidelines (footnote 2). An evaluation framework in
Appendix 3 provides evaluation criteria and questions. These questions will be addressed
alongside the key issues in Section G.

39.        The CAPE will apply five main evaluation criteria: (i) relevance, (ii) effectiveness,
(iii) efficiency, (iv) sustainability, and (v) development impacts (Appendix 3). A weight of 20% will
be assigned to each criterion. The CAPE will review how ADB's program followed the related
30
   The program was established in 2001 as a project-based initiative that initially promoted economic cooperation
   through the enhancement of cross-border connectivity and facilitation of trade between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
   Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.
31
   The program is a regional organization comprising seven member states: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar,
   Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal constituting a
   contiguous regional unity, and aims to accelerate the economic growth and social progress.

guidelines, procedural requirements, and due diligence for project preparation and
implementation, and operation and maintenance.

40.     Sector portfolio assessments will be prepared to assess ADB supported project
performance in six operational areas: (i) energy, (ii) finance, (iii) public sector management,
(iv) transport, and (v) water and other urban infrastructure sectors, 32 and (vi) nonsovereign
operations. 33 The CAPE will conduct a simplified assessment for operations in the social
sectors (education and health) without rating performance given the limited number of projects
approved during the CAPE period (two in education and one in health), all of which are ongoing.
Projects that covered several sectors and that were originally categorized as multisector will be
reclassified to the most relevant sectors. 34 The CAPE will include a small case study to review
regulations for involuntary resettlement in India, and assess benefits in terms of the
government's policy and ADB's policy. Findings of the case study will be fed into the ongoing
study, Real-Time Evaluation of ADB's Safeguard Experience: Country Case Studies.

41.     The CAPE will be based on a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods: document and
file study; data analysis; interviews and consultations with ADB staff, beneficiaries, and other
stakeholders; field observations; and survey questionnaires. Information will be drawn from ADB
project databases and from previous IED reports. These include project completion and project
validation reports and the findings of project performance evaluation reports for projects that
closed during the evaluation period. Data will be collected through project field visits, desk
studies, stakeholder consultations, and survey questionnaires where feasible. The CAPE will
triangulate and verify quantitative and qualitative data and information from different sources.

42.    Given the large size and diversity of the ADB program in India, it is not possible to
evaluate every project in-depth within the available time and budget. Nevertheless, the CAPE
team will endeavor to conduct as many field and project visits as feasible and communicate with
as many key stakeholders, especially executing and implementing agencies, as possible. While
senior staff in most executing and implementing agencies in New Delhi will be interviewed, only
selected agencies in other states can be covered. IED will work with the India Resident Mission
and government to coordinate field and project visits. 35 Projects that have been fully or largely
completed will be prioritized for field visits. Where necessary, the team will set interviews
through video and telephone conferences. A stakeholder perceptions survey will be conducted
online among all key stakeholder groups, including the government, beneficiary groups, and
other development partners, civil society, and the private sector.

43.    The CAPE will use data sources from operational departments, executing and
implementing agencies, and existing independent evaluation reports, supplemented by further
evidence collected during the evaluation missions. Generally, data collection through surveys
and other methods is part of ADB and executing agencies' project and strategy monitoring. As
stated in the revised CAPE guidelines (footnote 2), the onus is on ADB and the agencies
responsible to make this relevant data available when IED starts the evaluation; IED does not
have the resources and time to collect large amounts of primary data on its own.
32
   Two projects classified in the transport sector will be assessed in the water and other urban infrastructure sector
   given the nature of these projects and for consistency with other projects.
33
   Given the small financial share of the agriculture and natural resources sector (1.9% of the portfolio over the
   evaluation period), the CAPE will not carry out a sector assessment for this sector, but key projects under the
   sector will be reviewed and discussed in the CAPE main report.
34
   Two projects classified as multisector will be included in the water and other urban sector assessment and another
   two multisector projects will be included in the finance sector assessment.
35
   An indicative list of projects to be visited for each sector assessment has been developed and provided to the India
   Resident Mission.
                                                                                                                13



44.     As recognized in the revised CAPE guidelines (footnote 2), quantifying and isolating the
development impact of ADB support will not be easy. Each ADB intervention would have
produced some results, but overall country development impacts materialized from the
cumulative interventions and projects of ADB, other development partners, and the government.
In the absence of data on these contributions, it may be difficult to assess whether and to what
extent ADB's interventions caused any change in the country. There are data gaps between
project and country levels impacts. Consequently, the CAPE will focus on assessing whether
plausible linkages can be made between ADB's program, with emphasis on sector programs
and contributions, and the achievement of country objectives. 36

I.      Related Project Evaluations

45.    IED will undertake three project evaluation studies to build up the stock of independently
assessed project performance and complement the CAPE sector assessments and main
analysis. The three projects were selected from three large sectors in financial terms, namely
the energy, transport, and water and other urban infrastructure sectors, and will cover sovereign
and nonsovereign operations. 37 Findings of the evaluation studies will provide inputs to the
sector portfolio assessments and the CAPE main report.

J.      Implementation Arrangements

46.     The evaluation will be prepared by a team of senior evaluation specialists/co-team
leaders (B. Graham and T. Yokota), supported by principal evaluation specialists (K. Thukral
and N. Subramaniam), an evaluation specialist (G. Kilroy), evaluation officers (N. Gamo,
L. Guevara, and L. Ocenar), and administrative staff (E. Li-Mancenido and V. Melo-Cabuang). It
will be based on assessments of the important sector programs and nonsovereign operations.
Sector assessments will be carried out by the team led by T. Yokota for transport operations,
B. Graham for public sector management, finance, and social sectors operations (simplified
assessment), G. Kilroy for water and other urban infrastructure operations, K. Thukral and
L. Guevara for energy operations, and N. Subramaniam and N. Gamo for nonsovereign
operations. C.J. Mongcopa will support portfolio analysis and in-country coordination for the IED
mission. To support the team, consultants will be engaged individually following ADB's
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as updated from time to time). To ensure quality,
internal and external peer reviews will be implemented.

47.     It is proposed that the CAPE activities be carried out in accordance with the following
preliminary schedule. However, it is subject to timely support from ADB, and the Indian national
and local governments, in areas such as mission clearance, provision of data and documents,
arrangement of meetings during the evaluation missions, and review of the draft CAPE report.




36
   The revised CAPE guidelines provide more discussion on assessing development impacts and limitations related
   thereto, in particular paras. 28-30, Table 1, para. 44, and Appendix 4 (Guidance on Assessing Development
   Impacts).
37
   Three projects are (i) Karnataka Urban Development and Coastal Environmental Management Program. The
   evaluation approach paper was approved in September 2015. The study commenced in October 2015 and will be
   completed by the end of March 2016; (ii) the Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited (the evaluation approach paper
   for this evaluation is under development). The study will commence in early 2016 and will be completed by the end
   of May 2016; and (iii) National Highway Corridor Project. The evaluation approach paper will be developed. The
   study will commence in early 2016 and will be completed by the end of May 2016.
