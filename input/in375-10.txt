                                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 


Background

        The Independent Evaluation Department has undertaken technical assistance
performance evaluation reports (TPERs) in the environment sectors of the People's Republic of
China (1997, 2003); Mongolia (2001); and the Central Asian republics (2007), Indonesia and the
Philippines (2010); and prepared a background paper on the Greater Mekong Subregion's
Environment Program in 2009. However, a similar TPER has not been done for South Asia. This
TPER for South Asia, which includes case studies from India and Sri Lanka and desk reviews of
technical assistance (TA) projects in other countries of the region, fills part of the evaluation gap.
In addition, the TPER endeavors to provide an insight for more effective capacity development
both for environment and general TA.

       The TPER undertakes detailed evaluation of four case study TA projects in India and Sri
Lanka, and provides evaluation summaries based on desk reviews for TA projects in other
countries. India and Sri Lanka were used for case study TA projects because between them,
they covered a wider range of time period of ADB assistance and variety in environmental
management-related development issues.

         In the early 1990s, a string of important economic reforms in India helped usher in a
period of rapid economic growth that lifted millions of Indians out of poverty and gave rise to a
new middle class. However, since 41.6% people are still earning less than $1.25 per day,
continued growth, accompanied by suitable pro-poor measures, remain essential for further
reduction of poverty. Despite extensive environmental governance at central and state levels,
environmental degradation has not yet been halted in India. The country's high population
density, unequal distribution of ecological resources, and continued reliance on natural
resources to sustain the livelihood of many make more stringent environmental management
critical for sustaining the tempo of economic development. Further reforms of policy and its
application are needed. India's National Environment Policy and the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) Notification of 2006 are steps in the right direction.

       Between 1980 and 2000, Sri Lanka took several major steps to institutionalize its
environmental management. The National Environment Act was passed in 1980, the Central
Environment Authority (CEA) was established 1 year later, and a landmark 13th constitutional
amendment that granted provincial government legislative and executive power over
environmental matters was approved. These achievements may have been overshadowed by
the prolonged internal civil conflict that sapped the strength of the bureaucracy, including its
environmental ranks. Sri Lanka, like other developing countries of the region, faces the familiar
problems of resource depletion and degradation that negate environmental success stories.

        The Asian Development Bank's (ADB's) program of environmental TA to South Asia has
been under way since the late 1980s. In the area of environmental capacity development, this
has resulted in the implementation of 12 advisory and small-scale TA projects in India and four
such TA projects in Sri Lanka since 1989. Four of the more recent TA projects were selected as
case studies for evaluation based on their focus on capacity building and institutional
strengthening in environment: (i) Environmental Management at the State Level (India),
(ii) Capacity Building for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) (India), (iii) Institutional
Strengthening for EIA (Sri Lanka), and (iv) Capacity Building of the Environmental and Social
Division (ESD) of the Road Development Authority (Sri Lanka). Desk reviews of project-related
vi


documents and field visits to India and Sri Lanka were carried out for discussion with
stakeholders.

        In addition, six TA projects in Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Nepal were
evaluated through a desk-review process: (i) Urban Transport and Environmental Improvement
(Bangladesh), (ii) Strengthening EIA Capabilities and Preparation of Environmental Guidelines
(Bhutan), (iii) Capacity Building to Implement Environmental Assessment Procedures (Bhutan),
(iv) Promoting Sound Environmental Management in the Aftermath of the Tsunami Disaster
(Maldives), (v) Institutional Strengthening of the Nepal Electricity Authority's Environmental
Division (Nepal), and (vi) Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Population and
Environment (Nepal).

        The TPER assesses ADB's performance in designing and implementing the TA projects.
Assessment is based on the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of the TA
projects' contribution to the countries' capability to manage their environment in line with their
own and ADB's environment policy. In addition, the TPER endeavors to provide an insight into
more effective capacity development from both environment and general TA. The evaluation
also considers the extent to which ADB's assistance has helped South Asia, in particular India
and Sri Lanka, develop own environmental safeguard systems and procedures, and bring them
close to international good practice.

Key Findings

       The TA projects evaluated in this study have generated several insights:

         Start-up delays of up to 10 months affected most TA projects. Despite the knowledge
that ADB is unable to influence the approval process in the respective governments, TA design
(timing, fielding of consultants, disbursement, etc.) did not anticipate and suitably counter these
initial delays.

         Continuity of personnel and ownership affected implementation. Ownership by ADB and
the executing agency becomes a critical element in generating planned outcomes and
sustaining them. Ownership is strengthened when those responsible for TA design both on ADB
and developing member country side stay involved with TA activities for a prolonged period of
time if not until its end. Both TA projects in India were affected by staff changes at ADB, and the
environmental management TA had to go through significant changes to implementing
agencies' staffing.

        Donor coordination was an important element of TA delivery. Smart donor coordination
has an impact on the results of the TA. This was demonstrated on more than one occasion in
the TA projects evaluated. The environmental management TA in India overlapped with a
similar project of the World Bank and with other government-funded initiatives, both during
implementation and after. In part because of it, the effectiveness of the ADB TA suffered. The
EIA TA in Sri Lanka admittedly did a better job of donor coordination as did the capacity building
for CDM TA in India.

        Enabling conditions such as incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises to go
beyond compliance and adopt cleaner production as a production efficiency measure under the
environmental management TA in India to convert an output to a useful outcome were not
present. All TA projects produced outputs of good quality; however, the conditions that would
turn them into a more useful product were not always present. The exception was the ESD TA
                                                                                               vii


in Sri Lanka where economically vital road transport projects integrated environmental and
social safeguards with development, resulting in better buy-in from stakeholders and
government alike.

        The TA projects ended with no significant follow-up. This resulted in a loss of
momentum, poor uptake of the outputs that were produced, and consequently few to no
outcomes. Under the environmental management TA in India, for instance, no significant follow-
up has taken place from ADB, or the Ministry of Environment and Forest, and state pollution
control boards (SPCBs) to build on the action blueprint developed for environmentally sound
project promotion whether through information sharing, capacity development, policies and
regulations, or financing.

        Further support to country safeguard systems in Sri Lanka will give it a new lease of life
in a post-conflict environment bringing it to forefront of development planning. Next stage of
reforms could focus on (i) a clearer definition of roles and responsibility of CEA including its
provincial offices, project-approving agencies, provincial environment authorities, and EIA
technical review committees; (ii) training for better initial environmental examination and EIA,
including environmental management and monitoring plans; (iii) legislation to introduce strategic
environmental assessment as a mandatory tool for large regional projects with potential for
cumulative impacts; and (iv) enactment of statutes where appropriate, granting provincial
environment authorities responsibility for conducting the EIA process.

       Collaboration between central and state or provincial environmental agencies could have
been improved by the TA projects. In India, under the environmental management TA, the
federal nature of environmental governance affected coordination between the Ministry of
Environment and Forest and the SPCBs. In Sri Lanka, due to the absence of a statute for
decentralization (except for North West Province), the authority for EIA approvals remained
vested in CEA. Prevailing legislative framework in both countries, therefore, reduced the
potential of the two TA projects to develop strong center­state partnerships on environmental
management. To that extent, it was a missed opportunity.

       While capacity-development assistance from ADB more recently has focused on
supporting implementation of national climate change action plans to South Asian countries,
ADB needs to continue to stay engaged with strengthening of country safeguard systems in
both India and Sri Lanka, as the former seeks further economic growth and the latter unravels
ambitious infrastructure development plans in a post-conflict environment.

        The TPER rated the four case study TA projects as 1 successful, 2 partly successful, and
1 unsuccessful. The environmental management TA in India rated unsuccessful was affected by
numerous design and implementation issues. The CDM TA in India was rated partly successful;
raising CDM finance for municipal projects remains a challenge and the depth of understanding of
the CDM-informed formulation of projects at municipal level remains uncertain. The EIA TA in Sri
Lanka is rated partly successful having left an unfinished agenda of strengthening the EIA system
across CEA, project approval, and provincial agencies including issues pertaining to
environmental governance. The ESD TA in Sri Lanka succeeded in building a strong foundation
for the ESD at the Road Development Authority to support ADB's National Highway Sector
Program and other transport development projects in the country, rated as successful.

       In 3 out of 6 TA projects, the TPER desk review retained self-evaluation ratings, while
the remaining 3 were downgraded due to their inability to influence sustainable development
outcomes as envisaged at the time of TA approval.

Lessons for Environment Capacity Development Technical Assistance

        Environmental agencies need long-term sustained assistance. Environment
agencies need to stay abreast of the latest advances in global environmental technology, which
is not easy in a developing member country given the competing demand on limited resources
and the externality nature of environmental management. Where an external donor agency is
the primary source of such assistance, a programmatic approach--a long-term process that
assists ongoing capacity development, with each intervention forming part of a longer-term
agenda to build environmental management capacity at national or provincial level--has a
better chance of success than an isolated TA. Lack of such sustained assistance affected the
long-term outcomes of the Sri Lanka EIA TA.

        Sector-specific environment capacity development stands a better chance of
success if associated with a project or a program. An environment-strengthening TA that is
associated with infrastructure lending can be more effective in reforming environmental
practices if loan tranches are linked to progress on the TA project's milestones. The ESD TA in
Sri Lanka benefited from this approach.

       Municipal CDM projects have long-term development benefits. Although complex in
nature owing to scale and multitude of stakeholder involvement, municipal CDM projects in
populous countries and regions (as in the case of the CDM TA in India) may well offer an
unusually attractive combination of environmental and social benefits. Because of this,
continued TA will be relevant if good ownership is evident.

       Access to primary data is essential for robust environmental scrutiny. The
absence of an agreed data-sharing protocol is emerging as a major source of inefficiency in
administering environmental safeguards, because it leads to needless duplication and delays. It
increases the cost of the process, reduces its credibility, and imposes unnecessary burden on
the regulated community.

       Decentralization of environmental assessment without adequate institutional
capacity at provincial levels leads to inefficiencies. Decentralization of environmental
assessment and management functions, accompanied with stronger local capacity, is the need
of the hour in both India and Sri Lanka. The environmental clearance process (2006) in India
enshrines decentralization of decision making at the state level. However, due to varying levels
of economic development in states, it often meets limited capacity and skills in scoping and
reviewing EIAs at the state environment departments, SPCBs, and the appraisal committees. In
Sri Lanka, absence of enabling statutes and capacity constraints limits devolution of EIA
decision making to the provinces.

Lessons for General Capacity Development Technical Assistance

        Unduly broad terms of reference tend to weaken TA focus. A TA with a very large
scope ends up becoming irrelevant sooner rather than later. The result is excessive cost and
duration of the project and rising disproportion between the volume of consultant outputs and
the readiness of the client to use them. Effectiveness is stronger when assistance is focused on
relatively few areas, rather than scattered over a large range of sectors and states.

     Shared responsibility for cluster TA management is ineffective. The environmental
management TA in India has clearly demonstrated the importance of one ADB officer managing
                                                                                                 ix


the overall cluster, instead of having different officers responsible for its different components.
Involvement of different mission leaders in developing a cluster TA can well be justified, but
extending that approach to implementation is not.

        Infrequent dialogue with TA counterparts affects performance. Institutional reform is
a slow and demanding process, one that requires close partnership between ADB and the
executing agency, built on trust. Periodic supervising missions from ADB headquarters stand
less of a chance to generate that trust.

         Absence of a mandate reduces the executing agency's efficacy in knowledge
transfer through the TA. Executing agencies are responsible for adopting and disseminating
the TA product and require a clear mandate, complementary institutional preconditions, and
skills to do so. In the absence of these, the transfer of know-how, expected of TA projects, will
not occur or be seriously diminished, as was demonstrated in the cleaner production financing
component of the environmental management TA in India.

Recommendations

     The following recommendations on TA formulation are provided for consideration of ADB
Management during the country partnership strategy formulation in India and Sri Lanka.

       Develop a programmatic approach to environment capacity-development TA
(para. 105). TA projects should be appropriately sequenced or phased to support country and
sector assessment strategy and road maps with clearly identifiable performance indicators.
Greater participation of the government in the development of such TA program should be
encouraged.

       Draw on ADB resident missions for design and implementation of environment
capacity-development TA and country safeguard systems (para. 106). More use of ADB
resident mission staff should be considered both at design and implementation stages to ensure
ownership and continuity of TA outcomes in particular for cluster projects.

       Assist in building strong environmental governance to ensure transparent and
cost-effective TA outcomes (para. 107). ADB should support improved environmental
governance to ensure transparent and cost-effective TA outcomes, reducing the cost of
environmental compliance while achieving its quality objectives.

                                           I.      INTRODUCTION              


A.        Evaluation Purpose and Process

1.      Technical assistance performance evaluation reports (TPERs) have been undertaken in
the environment sector of the People's Republic of China (PRC) (1997, 2003); Mongolia (2001);
the Central Asian republics (2007); Indonesia and the Philippines (2010); and a background
paper on the Greater Mekong Subregion's Environment Program was prepared in 2009. South
Asia is markedly absent from these evaluations. This TPER for select countries of South Asia
proposes to close that gap.1 In addition, the TPER endeavors to provide an insight for more
effective capacity development both for environment and general technical assistance (TA).

2.     Another aspect of evaluation was to assess how the Asian Development Bank's (ADB's)
assistance has helped India and Sri Lanka develop their country safeguard systems (CSS) and
procedures, and identify what more work is required to strengthen the CSS.

3.       ADB's program of TA to South Asia has been under way since the late 1980s; and in the
area of environmental capacity development, 39 advisory and small-scale TA projects have been
implemented. Evaluation focuses on TA projects specifically targeted toward capacity building and
institutional strengthening in environment. All the TA projects in the region were reviewed, and
those not meeting the criteria as illustrated in Box 1 were excluded from the selection process.
The TA population is shown in Appendix 1. Of the 15 eligible TA projects, the four TA projects
approved more recently were selected for detailed case study evaluation. They are
(i) Environmental Management at the State Level (India), (ii) Capacity Building for Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) (India), (iii) Institutional Strengthening for Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) (Sri Lanka), and (iv) Capacity Building of the Environmental and Social Division
(ESD) of the Road Development Authority (RDA) (Sri Lanka). TA details are in Appendix 1.

                                   Box 1: TA Case Study Selection Criteria
Only technical assistance (TA) projects with environmental capacity development are included. TA
projects (or regional TA projects) associated with specific environmental issues (e.g., air quality
management in Asia) or assistance for a conference or event excluded. Multitranche financing facilities,
grants, and trust funds were also reviewed, but none met these criteria.
Project preparatory TA and small-scale TA projects were not selected as they concerned delivery of a
specific event, or project preparation, rather than countrywide institutional strengthening (29 selected).
Time period ­ TA projects approved in 1996­2009 (so selected taking into account institutional memory,
reliability of information, and availability of stakeholders to consult, 15 selected).

        Capacity Building TA Projects in (i) South Asia, and (ii) Indonesia and Philippines--Evaluation Approach

4.      Of the 11 remaining eligible TA projects, five that concern developing capacity in climate
change adaptation plans for developing member countries (DMCs) in South Asia have either
recently mobilized or are in their early stages of implementation, and were not evaluated. The
other six TA projects--in Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Nepal--have been evaluated
through a desk review. These are (i) Urban Transport and Environmental Improvement
(Bangladesh), (ii) Strengthening EIA Capabilities and Preparation of Environmental Guidelines
(Bhutan), (iii) Capacity Building to Implement Environmental Assessment Procedures (Bhutan),
(iv) Promoting Sound Environmental Management in the Aftermath of the Tsunami Disaster
(Maldives), (v) Institutional Strengthening of the Nepal Electricity Authority's Environmental

Division (Nepal), and (vi) Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Population and
Environment (Nepal) (Appendix 1).

5.      The TPER assesses the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of TA
projects' contribution to the countries' capability to manage their environment in the context of
ADB's and the national government's environment policy. This TPER undertakes detailed
evaluation of four case study TA projects in India and Sri Lanka, and provides evaluation
summaries based on desk reviews for TA projects in other countries.

6.      A desk review of the TA documents and other relevant studies and papers was conducted
in April­May 2010. An independent evaluation mission (IEM) then held field discussions with
representatives of executing agencies, other counterpart agencies associated with TA
implementation, officials of the Ministry of Finance, in-country offices of other multilateral and
bilateral funding agencies, nongovernment organizations, consultants for the TA projects, and
project stakeholders. The IEM to India was undertaken in June 2010, followed by a visit to
Colombo as part of the Sri Lanka IEM in early July 2010. At the time of the IEM, all TA projects
were completed and closed, although the ESD TA is awaiting financial closure, with TA activities
only completed in December 2009 and loan activities still ongoing. Questionnaires were circulated
to the executing agencies, TA implementation consultants, and ADB project officers to solicit their
views. Appendix 2 presents the evaluation design matrix adopted for the study. The pertinent
departments of ADB and executing agencies in the two countries were given copies of the draft
evaluation report for feedback. Comments received were considered to the extent possible. The
main text of the TPER presents the key findings of the evaluation of the four case study TA
projects in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Preparing Performance Evaluation Reports for
Public Sector Operations.2 Details of the individual evaluations of the four case study TA projects
are presented in Appendixes 3­6. Appendix 7 provides evaluation summaries based on desk
reviews for the other six TA projects.

7.        The environmental management TA in India was an interesting selection for evaluation
on more than one account. Besides being a large TA with a $3.6 million budget allocation--
initially designed for completion over a 3-year period, with one executing and four implementing
agencies across four different administrative regions--it was also the first cluster TA for India on
environmental management. The organizational dynamics of the environment establishment in
India at central and state levels was to be an important element in the performance of the TA.
The CDM TA was a first in disseminating CDM knowledge and capacity development to
municipalities and urban local bodies.

8.       The EIA TA in Sri Lanka was the first TA by ADB to instill EIA skills in the Central
Environment Authority (CEA) at a time when the country was still struggling with an internal civil
conflict. Finally, the choice of evaluation of the ESD TA was significant because in the post-
conflict environment, Sri Lanka will embark on a massive road-building program for the Northern
Province, and readiness of RDA and ESD to address environmental and social issues will play
an important part in sustainable development of such infrastructure.

9.      Technical assistance completion reports. The technical assistance completion
reports (TCRs) were prepared for all except the Sri Lanka ESD TA (as TA activities were only
completed in July 2009). According to the TCR, the environmental management TA was rated
partly successful bordering on successful.3 The TCR notes that during 2000­2004, when the TA
was being established, the environmental priorities of the target states changed considerably,

which meant refocusing some of the activities while still maintaining the overall objective. The
TCR also cites implementation delays across all components and prolonged deliberations with
executing and implementing agencies toward finalizing the scope. The IEM believes that while
objective in reporting the achievements and shortcomings, the TCR gives much prominence to
protracted deliberations with the government in assigning the overall rating. The TCR on the
CDM TA rates it partly successful. The TCR is well written, addressing various TA details of
impact, inputs, output, and outcome, and concludes that the TA made a contribution to
mainstreaming CDM for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction through capacity building of
various stakeholders in specific CDM sectors. The TCR on EIA TA in Sri Lanka rates it
successful. It diligently lists all the outputs produced under the TA but fails to adequately advise
the reader on the outcomes and impact achieved under the TA and can be said to be lenient in
its overall rating. In all cases, the TCRs were written by the project officer in charge of TA
implementation and by those that closed the TA. The TCRs, in most part were satisfactory,
although two had their overall assessment rating downgraded.

B.     Technical Assistance Objectives

10.      The overall objective of the environmental management TA in India was to create a
climate conducive for environmentally sound economic development through proactive
collaboration between the central and state governments. Policies that promoted environmental
management guidelines for (then) new initiatives such as cleaner production and supported
institutions such as state environmental management bodies were seen as vehicles for delivering
this goal. A key output was a more efficient EIA administration process, including stricter
enforcement of rules and regulations for pollution control by the state pollution control boards
(SPCBs). The TA had five components addressing various aspects of environmentally sound
project (ESP) planning for different SPCBs (component A for promotion and assessment of
environmentally sound projects, B for feasibility planning for environment management institute, C
for adopting environmental management strategies at state level, D for financing cleaner
production, and E for integrated environmental management case study of the West Bengal
Pollution Control Board [WBPCB]). Additional activities not included in the initial framework were
implemented during the TA's extension period and helped further develop tools and techniques for
better environmental planning and decision making. Details are provided in Appendix 3.

11.      The objective of the CDM TA in India was to promote reduction of GHG emissions
through efficient implementation of CDM projects; for example, by building capacity in municipal
jurisdictions via a learning-by-doing approach and real-life CDM project development to
demonstrate best practices and guidelines. Operational toolkits and handbooks for small-scale
CDM projects were to be disseminated to project developers, regulatory bodies, and financial
and insurance organizations in India.

12.     The objective of the EIA TA in Sri Lanka was to strengthen the capacity of central and
provincial agencies (through provincial councils) in the conduct of EIA via training, development
of improved EIA guidelines, and interagency coordination toward integrating environmental
considerations in project development planning. The goal was to get EIA accepted as a project-
planning tool. The ESD TA in Sri Lanka had the modest but very important objective of
establishing an ESD within the RDA that addresses environmental, social, and land acquisition
and resettlement (LAR) aspects of highway development.

13.    The design and monitoring framework (DMF) of the India environmental management
TA did not accurately depict the outputs of each component as described in the text of the main
TA paper. While the DMF makes no mention of market-based instruments (MBIs), the TA paper
4


gives them prominence. Agreement on the outputs of TA components eventually required
prolonged discussion with the executing and implementing agencies after the TA had become
effective. No inconsistencies between the TA paper and TA framework appeared in other case
study TA projects. The ESD TA was associated with the National Highways Sector Project and
did not have a separate DMF.4

                                II.     DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

A.        Rationale

14.      At the time the environmental management cluster TA was implemented, India's
economy was beginning to benefit from the market reforms of 1990s. Environmental
management responsibilities were however divided between several government authorities,
i.e., the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF), the Central Pollution Control Board, state
environment departments, and SPCBs. There was scope for harmonizing various central and
state approaches toward environmentally sound development, and the potential to demonstrate,
share, and replicate results. In formulating the environmental cluster TA, ADB tapped into that
potential (see Figure).

15.     India's environment governance framework was characterized by a command-and-
control regime, one that was designed to punish the violator rather than prevent the violation in
the first place through suitable incentives or disincentives and proactive interventions. The

Bhopal gas-leak disaster of December 1984 precipitated the tightening of environmental
regulations. However, at the start of the millennium, both the government and industry felt that
the legislative framework was not effective and inhibited investment in the country. The
institutional framework whereby MOEF, state environment departments, and the Central
Pollution Control Board had limited or non-specific roles in the EIA process, and pollution control
issues and enforcement were largely delegated to the states and its pollution control boards, did
not help improve the situation. Most of these institutions were also insufficiently equipped with
human resources, skills, and budgets to address the environmental and pollution problems
typical of a rapidly growing urban and industrial economy. Box 2 highlights some of the
prevailing inefficiencies in India's EIA system at the time.

              Box 2: Govindarajan Report on Reform of Environmental Clearancesa, India
The report notes that the existing environmental regulations are time-consuming and require undue effort;
entail a cumbersome process whereby disproportionate details are sought for environmental clearance
applications and delays take place in appraisal meetings; technical issues are reopened at various stages
of appraisal; environmental impact assessment studies are of a poor quality, leading to suboptimal
regulation; and there are delays at other agencies involved.

16.    The environmental management TA responded to the government's request to ADB and
was included in the TA pipeline of India's country assistance plan (CAP) for 1999­2001.5 What
was missing was a more harmonized practice of environmental management where the central
and state governments would use a similar underlying approach to common problems (with a
measure of state specificity) and benefit from mutual support built on a platform of lessons
learned and synergies. With that in mind, the environmental management TA targeted selected
SPCBs (through components B, C, and E), while assigning, through component A, a proactive
coordinating role to MOEF to address both chronic (e.g., poor enforcement of EIAs and
environmental monitoring plans) and emerging issues such as slow introduction of cleaner
production and integrated economic and environment planning.

17.     The aim of the India CDM TA was to support the development of a national CDM
strategy in anticipation of the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2002 and the establishment of the National Clean
Development Mechanism Authority in December 2003. The TA complemented ADB's broader
environmental objectives, including clean energy development and utilization, as described in its
country strategy and program (CSP) 2003­2006.6 Given the potential for significant reductions
of GHG emissions at low marginal abatement costs across energy, transport, forestry,
agriculture, and other sectors (including at the small-scale rural and municipal levels), India
could well play a major role in the global CDM market. However, considerable capacity
development was required to realize this potential. The TA targeted some of this wide group of
stakeholders, raising their awareness, knowledge, and skills in developing project design
documents (PDDs), including necessary financial and risk management planning.

18.    In Sri Lanka, the EIA TA was provided essentially to assist the Ministry of Transport,
Environment, and Women Affairs (MTEWA) through CEA, established in 1980, in addressing

organizational capacity issues of project-approving agencies (PAAs).7 Order 859/14 of 1995 had
designated 14 ministries and 8 agencies as PAAs, i.e., those mandated to supervise the
administration of EIAs for development projects (as defined by Order 772/72 of 1993). In
addition, the TA's interventions were focused on building the capacity of provincial councils to
address EIA issues at their level.

19.     The ESD TA, though not part of the Sri Lanka CSP update, was nevertheless submitted
for Board approval in August 2005, with the following strong rationale. The National Highways
Project was to be the first sector loan to be executed by the RDA. While RDA had the technical
capacity to implement the project, it required assistance with safeguard aspects of road
development. The TA's approval was cited to be critical as (i) RDA had to institutionalize the
safeguard lessons gained from the implementation of the Southern Transport Development
Project, following recommendations from the Compliance Review Panel; (ii) RDA needed to
prepare subsequent environmental study and resettlement plans of the subprojects of the
National Highways Project in compliance with ADB's and the government's policy and
requirements; and (iii) the National Highways Project was also to finance LAR expenditure that
required institutional capacity and effective management information systems at RDA. Given the
experience with the Southern Transport Development Project, it was evident that the success of
the National Highways Project was inextricably linked to the successful execution of this
associated TA on safeguard capacity building at RDA.

20.       The rationale of all four TA projects was sound both at approval and evaluation.

B.        Formulation

21.   All four TA projects selected for India and Sri Lanka addressed environmental
management issues that were relevant to the countries' development environment, both then
and now.

22.     The environmental management TA in India came with the knowledge and benefit of
ADB's prior involvement in the environment sector (Appendix 3, para. 16) with a focus on urban
environment infrastructure, renewable energy, and capacity development for environmental
management, policy, and planning. TA formulation also benefited from ongoing assistance from
other multilateral agencies and continued domestic reforms at that time.8 As discussed (para.
14), the cluster approach to TA implementation was adopted to enable sharing of lessons
learned across states and harnessing synergies that could sustain TA outcomes beyond its life.
A fact-finding mission in August 1999 and a follow-up mission in October 1999 were fielded for
ADB and the government to reach agreement on the components, objectives, scope, budget,
and implementation arrangements for the TA. Detailed scoping of components B­E was to be
undertaken during the inception mission after launch of component A. However, events during
the inception period resulting from a change of guard at MOEF meant that the ADB project
officer at the time had difficulty to get the TA started and had prolonged discussions with MOEF
regarding implementation arrangements and MOEF's role as the executing agency. ADB had to
manage the expectations that SPCBs and MOEF had of the TA. The TA, in fact, faced continual
implementation hurdles during its life, and the central coordinating role that MOEF was
envisaged to play never materialized. Coordination between MOEF as the executing agency
and the SPCBs as the implementing agencies remained a challenge throughout the TA

implementation and the implementing agency of component B, Gujarat State Pollution Control
Board, and ADB could not reach an agreement on the component's scope and assignment of
necessary counterpart staff, resulting in the cancellation of the component.

23.      The fact-finding mission for the CDM TA visited India in August 2004 to formulate the
proposed TA. The government, in collaboration with multilateral and bilateral agencies, was
preparing a national CDM strategy to coincide with the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol in
2005 (Appendix 4, para. 9). ADB's fact-finding mission team thus also met with representatives
from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and GTZ Technical Cooperation
Program to ensure coordination with other development partners on this initiative. The TCR
states that the TA was originally conceived by the Energy Division of the South Asia Department
(SAEN) in 2004 as associated to a loan to the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency.
As the loan did not materialize, SAEN and the Finance and Infrastructure Division of the
Regional and Sustainable Development Department assumed responsibility in formulating and
processing the TA.9 Ownership from MOEF's Division of Climate Change, the lead executing
agency group that remained strong both during formulation and implementation, was ably led by
its director, who remains passionate about the subject to this day.

24.     ADB's fact-finding mission for the EIA TA in Sri Lanka was fielded in October 1996. The
EIA TA was careful to avoid duplication of recent and ongoing (at that time) efforts by the World
Bank,10 United States Agency for International Development (USAID),11 the Japan International
Cooperation Agency, and UNDP (Appendix 5) in strengthening EIA systems by focusing its
efforts on the PAAs and the provincial councils. During the inception mission, meetings were
held with the Environment Action 1 Project (EA1P) project coordinator and UNDP (which was
assisting the National Planning Department at the time to develop principles and practices for
integrating sustainable development into economic development planning) to discuss the TA
scope of work and consultants' work plan. The EA1P was to complement the EIA TA.
Ownership from MTEWA and CEA was strong; however, more effort could have been put into
working with the provincial authorities and councils.

25.     ADB has provided more assistance to the transport sector in Sri Lanka than any other
sector. Environmental and social safeguards and related LAR planning issues have been at the
forefront of such assistance, requiring adept management from both ADB and the borrower. The
formulation of the ESD TA was undertaken alongside the formulation of the National Highways
Project. There were some delays in the signing of the TA agreement, as establishment of the ESD
was delayed (and was a condition for starting the TA). The TA associated with the National
Highways Project was seen as critical to the establishment and eventual development of these
safeguard skills within RDA. Ownership from RDA and the incipient ESD was very strong, and the
stakeholders appreciate the TA's contribution to this day.

C.      Cost, Financing, and Executing Arrangements

26.    The total cost of the TA projects, actual disbursement, and implementation
arrangements are presented in Table 1. The environmental management TA was financed on a
grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program, split as $2,020,000 under the 2000 TA program,
9
   Administration of the TA was turned over to SAEN in November 2005.
10
   EA1P, implemented during 1998­2003, focused on building the environmental management infrastructure at the
   Ministry of Environment and CEA's human resources development, and supporting the implementation of the
   National Environment Action Plan.
11
   The Natural Resources and Environmental Policy Project (NAREPP), implemented during 1991­1996, was
   instrumental in strengthening the legal framework and implementation tools for what was still an evolving EIA
   process.

$900,000 under 2001, and $700,000 under 2002. The CDM TA was financed on a grant basis
by the Government of Canada from the Canadian Cooperation Fund for Climate Change. Both
TA projects in Sri Lanka were funded entirely as a grant by ADB's TA program.

27.     There was one change to the implementation arrangements--the National Productivity
Council of India was dropped as the implementing agency for component D (financing of
cleaner production) of the environmental management TA due to conflict of interest. Instead,
MOEF was appointed as the implementing agency. Details are provided in Appendixes 3­6 for
the selected TA projects.

D.      Consultants and Scheduling

28.     Selection of international and national consultants for all the TA projects was in
accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. International consulting firms
supported by national consultants (through national consulting firms in some cases) were
recruited to implement the TA. Consultants for the ESD TA were recruited on an individual
basis. Table 2 provides a summary of the consulting inputs and deviations from the planned
allocations, if any. All TA projects had adjustments to inputs, but those were accommodated
within the original TA budget allocations. Details are provided in Appendixes 3­6.

29.     In summary:
        (i)   India. The quality of international and national consultants differed between the
              two India TA projects. The implementing agencies were not pleased with the
              performance of consultants to the environmental management TA under
                                                                                                                9


                 components A, C, and D, and the team leader of component A resigned during
                 TA implementation over differences with the consulting company's management.
                 ADB project officer(s) responsible for the environmental management TA also
                 indicated difficulties in the performance of the consultants for components A and
                 C. Work by the consultants on additional activities was, however, appreciated by
                 the implementing agencies. The performance of consultants on the CDM TA was
                 praised by the executing agency officials.
        (ii)     Sri Lanka. There was no team change in the EIA TA, but the international
                 safeguard specialist for the ESD TA was replaced because of illness. Overall,
                 ADB and executing agencies seemed generally satisfied with the international
                 and national consultant inputs.

30.     TA completion was delayed in most cases for various reasons (discussed in chapter III,
section D). All TA projects experienced start-up delays as well, either because the executing
agency was not ready (for instance, RDA had not been able to establish the ESD--a condition
for ESD TA effectiveness) or delays in agreement on details of scope or implementing
arrangements delayed signing of the TA agreement (e.g., environmental management TA in
India). That said, all delays were accommodated within the TA projects' original budgets. The
various reasons for the delays are given in Table 3.

E.       esign Changes
        D

31.    Most TA projects underwent changes in scope after TA approval and during
implementation to varying degrees within the allocated TA budget and overall TA objective. The
environmental management TA in India had the most changes to its scope. Delayed start to the
10


TA resulted in change of focus and priorities of some of the implementing agencies, which
required an adjustment to scope in some cases. Component A had no scope change. Changes
made were:
       (i)    Component B. Gujarat had already established an environmental management
              institute by the time the component was ready to be mobilized. Hence, carrying
              out a feasibility study was no longer needed for the Gujarat Pollution Control
              Board (GPCB); the proposed new scope included activities for (a) e-governance
              in which GPCB would integrate data available into a single database and
              introduce an online facility for the polluting units in the state for consent
              management; and (b) a study to estimate the contribution of air pollution from
              industrial, automobile, and other sources that would provide inputs to the
              preparation of an air quality improvement action plan for Ahmedabad.12
       (ii)   Component C. The scope was modified with removal of (a) pilot testing of MBIs,
              and (b) implementation of projects to demonstrate proposed policies and
              strategies to improve the enforcement of environmental rules and regulations.
       (iii)  Component D. The scope was revised to include training on principles and
              financing of cleaner production for officials from the financial services sector,
              state agencies such as SPCBs, and industrial estate associations to enable
              stakeholders to develop an understanding of cleaner production before
              attempting to advice on its financing challenges and remedial action.
       (iv)   Component E. The scope was initially designed to draw from the findings of the
              then ongoing Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project (Appendix 3, footnote
              3). However, the findings could not be used for the TA scope because of timing
              issues. Scope adjustment resulted instead in a wetland inventory management
              system; an integrated environmental management information system to digitize
              all WBPCB records (over 25,000 paper files at that time); development of a
              hazardous waste management policy; and a study of industrial and vehicular air
              pollution as an input into the Kolkata Air Pollution Management Plan.
       (v)    Additional activities. Savings from various components were then used to
              develop two follow-on activities under components C and E, and six new
              activities (Appendix 3, para. 14) were developed in consultation with the
              implementing agencies that allowed for better ownership from the implementing
              agencies and also a wider reach to stakeholders.

32.     The CDM TA in India had minor changes in scope without affecting the overall objective
of the TA (Appendix 4, para. 17). The EIA TA had the scope extended to deal with legal aspects
of an EIA and evaluate the use of a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and its legal
framework. Some additional training workshops were also undertaken. No change of scope was
effected for the ESD TA.

F.         Outputs

33.      The TA projects together produced a considerable written output, including technical
papers, action plans, guidelines, manuals, and data management systems, all targeted to
deliver on the scope of stronger environmental management, more effective EIA, and
associated institutional processes and training activities. The intended outcome of all the TA
projects was to strengthen beneficiaries' capacity for stronger environmental management, such
as ESP development methodology, cleaner production techniques, EIA guidelines, and
institutionalizing CDM initiatives. The TA framework developed for these TA projects (except the
12
     Component B was eventually canceled owing to Gujarat government's inability to resolve counterpart staffing
     arrangements.
                                                                                               11


ESD TA, being associated to the National Highways Sector Project) illustrates the proposed
outputs. Some of the expected outputs of the environmental management TA changed during
implementation due to design changes and changes to scope of work. Details of outputs
developed for each TA are presented in Appendixes 3­6.

34.     For the environmental management TA in India, component A produced reports on
promotion and assessment of ESPs including training workshops on EIA preparation and review
and promoting cleaner production. A review of the environmental clearance process in 2000­
2004 initiated by MOEF and the World Bank (para. 39) superseded some of the
abovementioned outputs and affected their value addition and usefulness for MOEF. No outputs
were produced for component B, as it was cancelled. Component C undertook an institutional
analysis of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) policies that would affect
environmental management and pollution control, along with awareness-building workshops.
MPPCB was not satisfied with the quality of the outputs and questioned their value addition, and
after substantive revisions and delays, the draft report was accepted. Component D developed
an action plan for promoting cleaner production financing. Scope variation led to pilot
demonstration of cleaner production financing in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
using self-assessment toolkits and environmental benchmarking in the paint and coating
industry. Without the cleaner production pilot self-assessment toolkit, the component was
struggling to develop a meaningful output. Component E developed an environmental
management information system at the WBPCB, an East Kolkata wetlands management plan, a
hazardous waste management action plan for the state, and an ambient air quality improvement
action plan for Kolkata City. Reports delivered were of high quality and praised by the WBPCB
and the East Kolkata Wetlands Management Authority. The additional activities had an array of
outputs all designed in consultation with the implementing agencies (Appendix 3, para. 58). All
the outputs were produced on time and their quality accepted by the respective implementing
agencies. With the exception of component E, outputs of all other components were accepted
by the implementing agencies only after substantial modifications.

35.     The main outputs and activities undertaken during the CDM TA in India included
(i) capacity-building workshops for municipalities and urban local bodies across Bangalore,
Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai; (ii) development of PDDs for the municipal sector; (iii) development
of a CDM fund concept to provide upfront financing for CDM projects; (iv) an action plan and
strategy for municipalities and urban local bodies for setting up a national CDM facilitation cell
as a platform for exchange of information; and (v) development of toolkits to assist small-scale
CDM project developers, and a risk management tool for the financial sector for project
appraisal and risk assessment. The PDDs prepared under the project were competently drafted
and found useful by all stakeholders. Equally satisfactory were the toolkits and the CDM fund
concept. MOEF's Climate Change Division converted the material into public information that
remains in high demand to this day. Both PDDs were ready to be submitted for host country
approval and validation, although the associated costs were recognized as a potential hurdle.

36.     In Sri Lanka, the EIA TA produced several outputs associated with developing the
capacity of staff working on EIA issues at CEA's EIA division and the PAAs. Reports were
produced on integrating environmental considerations in planning of public and private sector
projects, and improving environmental management at leveling the provinces. SEA was
introduced and a concept paper developed for power development. Training workshops were
held on EIA theory and practice, and on bringing the computer system at CEA up to date so as
to provide a warehouse of information for EIA professionals. A considerable number of reports
of uniformly good quality were produced. The problems in applying environmental safeguards in
Sri Lanka today, as highlighted in this TPER, owe more to a loss of momentum and some
setbacks since TA completion than to any inadequacy of the TA outputs themselves.
12



37.     The ESD TA produced several reports, manuals, and other documentation relevant to
building ESD's capacity to undertake environmental and social planning of RDA projects, in
particular, ADB's National Highway Project at the time. These included, for the environment
component, (i) operations manual for incorporating environmental consideration in RDA's
operation, including terms of reference (TOR) for a typical road initial environmental
examination (IEE) and checklists for EIA and environmental screening; and (ii) draft IEE reports
for the National Highway Project subprojects. However, outputs pertaining to environmental
management and monitoring at the construction stage of the subprojects of the National
Highways Project--environmental emergency program and semi-annual report on implementing
the environmental monitoring plan were not delivered during the life of the TA, although
sufficient capacity has been created in ESD to undertake these as construction progresses. The
social component of the TA delivered (i) an integrated manual on social assessment and
involuntary resettlement compliance manual, including information on preparing initial poverty
and social assessment as per ADB guidelines, all reviewed and approved by RDA and the LAR
steering committee; and (ii) formats for monitoring involuntary resettlement. All the outputs were
reviewed and approved by the project steering committee and ESD officials trained in the use of
the manuals. The final output of the TA was a management information system to monitor the
progress of LAR. The staff of ESD was trained in the use of the management information
system and other TA manuals through training workshops, field visits, and on-the-job training.
The material produced under the TA, in particular the Environmental Safeguards Manual and a
set of IEE reports, met ADB's and the executing agency's quality expectations.

G.         Policy Framework

38.     While no significant changes were made in macroeconomic and other policies during
implementation of the TA projects that would have significantly affected their success, the
following key policy directions were adopted by the governments of India and Sri Lanka at that
time and since then had an influence on the outcomes and success potential of the TA projects.

39.     From 1997, the Government of India began reforming environmental governance and to
that extent, the environmental management TA was very timely. The period saw promulgation of
various laws and policies on environmental, natural resources, and pollution control in part
supported by internal and external donor funding. The Govindarajan Committee Report on
Investment Reforms,13 which identified several hurdles in the environmental clearance process,
and the World Bank-sponsored Environment Management Capacity Building Project (EMCBP)
precipitated a number of government actions toward environmental reform. Notable outcomes
included the enactment of the National Environment Policy, which led to amendments to the EIA
Notification of 2006 and the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 1991. Although well timed, TA
products (especially component A) seemed to have been overtaken by the outcomes of the
aforementioned ongoing initiatives. Box 3 presents a chronology of key developments that
occurred during that time.




13
     The Govindarajan Committee was set up by the cabinet secretariat in September 2001 to recast the government's
     investment approvals and regulations framework by examining procedures for investment approvals and
     implementation of projects, and suggest measures to simplify and expedite the process of both public and private
     projects.

      conservation, development, and livelihood needs; submitted its report in February 2005.

  40.     In Sri Lanka, although the EIA was established in early 1980s, progress on strengthening
  environmental institutions and legislative framework, not to mention other administrative reforms
  were affected to some degree by the prolonged internal civil conflict, which diverted vital
  government resources and more importantly its attention away from making rapid progress in this
  direction. Box 4 highlights the key milestone events in the life of EIA and environmental
  management in Sri Lanka. The EIA process is primarily characterized by the use of prescribed
  screening lists to identify projects that must undergo environmental assessments, institutions with
  delegated authority to review and approve environmental assessments of projects, provisions for
  public participation in the EIA process, and the requirement for analysis of alternative proposals.
  The EIA TA attempted to carry forward the EIA capacity building process started by the USAID
  Natural Resources and Environmental Policy Project (NAREPP) and followed by the World Bank
  EA1P (para. 24) at both national and provincial levels.

                            III.    PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT                  


A.     Overall Assessment

41.     While an overall assessment has been carried out for each of the four TA projects, a
combined overall assessment was not made, nor for that matter of the cluster in each country.
This is due to the nature of the outputs and intended outcomes of the TA, which addressed
different sector-specific aspects (environmental management in a cluster arrangement and
CDM in India; and EIA strengthening on a national scale and in a road development agency
more than a decade apart).

42.      In India, the environmental management TA is rated unsuccessful (as against partly
successful bordering on successful in the TCR). The TA was a difficult project to implement. Its
cluster arrangement, while well intentioned, had an ambitious design with several consulting
groups working across various executing and implementing agencies in states with different work
cultures and development priorities. Lack of centralized coordination from ADB (until very late into
project implementation) was almost a recipe for delays and design changes, which became
necessary during the project's life. The overall assessment of TA performance should consider
the successes and failures of its individual components, additional activities, and set the results
against the TA's investment of $3.6 million and time taken to deliver. Given the large number of
design changes, the abandonment of an entire (second-largest) component, and the rather
modest impact the TA has had on the institutional landscape of environment management in
India, the TA is rated as only partly relevant. The actual outputs and outcomes, real as they may
be in the former category, bear little resemblance to the intentions outlined in the DMF. The
inability of ADB and the consultants to engage with the executing and implementing agencies,
which resulted in poor outcomes, warrants a less effective rating. ADB struggled to manage the
TA during the initial 2 years, although the situation improved once responsibility for the TA
administration was transferred to the resident mission. TA completion was delayed by 58 months.
Overall, the performance was inefficient. While India's national environmental management
systems have progressed and institutions such as MOEF, state environment departments, and
SPCBs have developed their capacity in stages, further improvement can be made in institutional
and legislative areas to smooth implementation of the EIA and pollution control processes. More
work is required to streamline environmental approvals for efficient implementation of
development projects. The environmental management TA had not been able to make a
measurable contribution to the evolution of India's environmental movement. Sustainability of the
TA outcomes is considered less likely. Although various outputs were produced during the TA's
tumultuous implementation, overall mainly by reference to the relationship between the results
obtained, when taking into account the inordinate completion delays and the huge investment
made ($3.6 million), it is difficult to rate the TA anything but unsuccessful.

43.     The CDM TA in India is rated partly successful (in agreement with the TCR rating). TA
implementation was marked by delays, and raising finance for municipal projects remains a
challenge and the depth of understanding of the CDM-informed formulation of projects at
municipal level remains uncertain. The main and lasting contribution of the TA may lie less in its
specific outputs and more in the approach and awareness it promoted. It provided timely
support to MOEF and was suitably linked to related assistance by UNDP and GTZ, which had
an ongoing program to enhance small and medium German companies with compliance in the
European Union emission trading scheme to use CDM and/or to transfer technology to avoid
duplication of activities. It targeted the municipal and financial sectors. Despite the
implementation and capacity challenges that these sectors face, the TA remains acutely
relevant to this day. On balance, the TA is rated partly successful.
                                                                                                                              15


      44.      In Sri Lanka, the EIA TA is rated partly successful (as against successful in the TCR). The
      TA was a timely follow-up to USAID-funded NAREPP and a good complement to the World Bank-
      supported EA1P. The evaluation needs to give adequate consideration to the impact of a conflict of
      the intensity and duration that it may have had on government machinery; and its resources and
      ability to keep stakeholders and civil society focused on striking a balance between maintaining
      peace, national security, and progressing environmental management. The project could not have
      escaped the impact of the internal conflict that sapped the energy of key government agencies.
      Having said that, the TA failed to recognize the challenges to central and provincial governance
      relationships and did not make adjustments to TA implementation and scope accordingly. EIA is still
      not an effective decision-making tool in Sri Lanka. The TA is rated partly successful on balance.
      45.      The ESD TA in Sri Lanka is rated successful. It is a good example of integrating
      environmental and social dimensions in an infrastructure agency's development agenda. A major
      push for road development is likely in Sri Lanka's post-conflict landscape, with an emphasis on
      infrastructure development in the Northern provinces. ESD's relevance in the new environment can
      only grow. ADB remains a major contributor to that development; an associated TA facility that
      mainstreams environmental safeguards and planning and ties in with the investment project will
      attract better attention of the decision makers than a stand-alone TA. The TA is rated successful.
      46.       The individual TA ratings are in Table 4.

      B.        Relevance

      47.     The principal factors considered in determining relevance were (i) consistency with ADB
      objectives and individual government priorities, (ii) strategy and adequacy of design scope and
      time frame, and (iii) evidence of participation or government ownership.
      48.    The environmental management TA in India was consistent with ADB's CAP for 1999­
      2001 (footnote 5) and with the government's strategy at the time to strengthen state capacity for
      environmental management. The TA was designed as a cluster, ostensibly to harness synergies
      across its various components, with an underlying common theme of improving environmental
      management in all states. One of the reasons for adopting a cluster approach was potential
      administrative efficiency and synergies through lessons that a coordinated approach to a series
16


of state activities could generate; it may inadvertently have contributed to a wishful design that
overstated the similarity of the states' environmental management priorities. Events after TA
approval show that the expected synergies remained largely on paper and that the components
operated independently of each other. Each state had a different set of environmental priorities
guided by local needs. The TA achieved little cohesion in the delivery of its components,
because the components ended up operating largely as individual projects without the links and
synergies envisaged at the outset. Some excellent additional activities introduced toward the
latter part of TA implementation (Appendix 3, para. 14) did not overcome the lack of cohesion.
The TA did not effectively make use of the ongoing donor and national government initiatives on
environmental management (para. 39). The TA framework was not entirely supported by the
design details in the TA paper, and even less so by the results obtained. The TA is rated partly
relevant. Discussion on relevance for each component is in Appendix 3.

49.    The CDM TA in India was very timely14 and pertinent to developing basic understanding
and awareness of CDM and CDM project design among the municipal and local stakeholders.
Although not listed specifically in the CAP for India, the CAP 2001­2003 talked about capacity
development for cleaner production and utilization of the CDMs. The TA was well designed and
had a solid start in the inception stage. There was strong support from the executing agency,
the Climate Change Division of MOEF, ably led by its director, who continues to be a valuable
supporter of the TA and its findings. Smaller CDM projects are still relevant today, and the TA
served to cement that relevance. The TA is rated relevant.

50.       The EIA TA in Sri Lanka was timely and pertinent to the needs of the environmental
establishment at the time, but it could have done a better job of building on the experience of
closely related earlier efforts, especially the USAID-funded NAREPP.15 While the legislative
framework was in place, little practical knowledge on application of EIA tools and techniques
existed, so a real impetus for putting EIA into operation had not been achieved by the time the EIA
TA was mobilized. However, the TA assumed that the EIA process was in place and functional. A
case in point is the role of the PAAs and their ability to support the EIA process, which was (and
still is) fraught with challenges. Greater emphasis could have been placed on strengthening the
PAAs and the provincial councils. The TA activities remained largely focused on the CEA, while its
interaction with the PAAs was effective mostly during training workshops. The TA would have
benefited from selecting a small group of PAAs and provinces as a focus for TA activities, and
mainstreaming the EIA agenda as a pilot in those select PAAs. The TA also tried to introduce SEA
in the 1990s, when the environmental establishment was only just coming to grips with the full
aspects of EIA. Stakeholders interviewed during the IEM were of the view that introduction of SEA
as part of the EIA TA scope was probably premature. To this day, there is no enabling legislation
to mandate SEA. The TA, though well timed and needed at the time, was thus partly relevant.

51.     The establishment and strengthening of the RDA's ESD received a major boost from the
ESD TA. The TA was associated with the National Highways Project, which was included in the
assistance pipeline for lending products in the CSP 2004­2008. The TA has been relevant to
the needs of the ESD and RDA in fostering awareness, and to ESD's capacity in dealing with
environmental and social aspects of road development in Sri Lanka. The TA was instrumental in
helping the project implementing units within the RDA understand and implement environmental
safeguards. Support from the counterpart staff at ESD was good, and recruitment of ESD staff
was well timed to ensure involvement in TA and National Highways Project implementation. The
TA is rated relevant.

C.       Effectiveness

52.     The TA frameworks designed at the time had unclear definitions of outcomes. The IEM
drew the desired outcomes from the TA papers and assessed the degree to which they were
achieved. The IEM found they varied across the different TA projects. None of the TA projects
could achieve the intended outcomes completely, attribution considered. Key factors reviewed
in determining effectiveness included TA management and attribution of TA outputs that led to
observed achievement of outcomes in relation to other factors.

53.     The environmental management TA in India produced numerous outputs (Appendix 3, para.
31). However, what was missing were conditions that would turn them into a more useful product
and hence an outcome. The choice of outputs was mostly consultant-driven and ADB-approved
rather than responding to clearly articulated wishes of the end user, i.e., the implementing
agency/agencies and their staff. On the flip side, staff movement within an implementing agency
meant that agreement on outputs with one set of decision-making officials could be reversed or
subject to further scrutiny by the succeeding group of officials, resulting in delays and continued
revision or refinement of outputs, which affected the quality of outcomes. The TA is rated less
effective overall. Discussion on effectiveness for each component is provided in Appendix 3.

54.     The CDM TA in India contributed to raising awareness of carbon finance for municipal
and finance sectors; the carbon finance guidebooks and toolkits produced are being used to this
day and remain in demand. The TA was an eye-opener for the stakeholders in industry and
government alike. Earlier interventions in CDM had been more project- and sector-oriented, and
the TA was the first attempt to promote and develop CDM capacity in the local bodies,
municipalities, and rural sectors. The project has also contributed to building carbon finance
capacity among local consultants, who could potentially be engaged in follow-up work after the
TA. However, raising finance for municipal projects remains a challenge and despite the
progress made, the depth of understanding of the CDM-informed formulation of projects at
municipal level remains uncertain. The CDM fund concept as proposed by the TA was not
implemented and the small-scale PDDs--energy efficiency improvement in a cluster of small
rice mills in Andhra Pradesh, and installation of solar-thermal driers for fruit and vegetables in
Hyderabad--were not pursued for lack of funding. The TA can thus be considered less
effective. Box 5 highlights some of the challenges faced by the CDM sector in India.

                          Box 5: Challenges to Clean Development Mechanism in India

Need for better, transparent, and comprehensive documentation of the projects for CDM approval; and
Encouragement of in-house capacity building at larger companies, PSUs, institutions, chambers of commerce, and

awareness; 

SME and bundling potential yet to be tapped;

Need to raise state and local policymakers' awareness of and sensitivity to CDM; and 

Data access, availability, and authenticity.

Integration of CDM Business into Main Business
Recognition of CDM skills as distinct to project skills; 

Training and development of staff specialized in CDM, to reach out to industry sectors; 

Integration of CDM into mandatory energy audits for industries; and 

Government's role as facilitator remains critical to organizing carbon trade fairs or expos.

55.      The EIA TA in Sri Lanka targeted the CEA and the PAAs for institutional strengthening. To
date, most of the PAAs remain severely constrained in their capacity to administer IEE-EIA
allocated to them by CEA. The TA was not able to generate enough momentum in strengthening
their participation in the EIA process. The formation and composition of the IEE­EIA technical
evaluation committees under the purview of the PAAs requires further strengthening, and stricter
qualification and expertise requirements need to be imposed on the membership of the
committees. Similarly, PAAs need strong environmental units with staff suitably qualified in
environmental issues. A key activity of the EIA TA was to strengthen the environmental role of the
PAAs, which did not materialize. The PAAs participated in the TA training workshops, but EIA
techniques and tools were not imbedded into the role of the PAAs, largely for lack of skilled human
resources. Owing to the weaknesses cited, the PAA-based system seems to have not worked
efficiently. As it stands, the system also runs the risk of a conflict of interest, since a project-
sponsoring agency can also act as the PAA (e.g., for the Kalpitiya Mega Tourism Project, the
Ministry of Tourism was both project sponsor and PAA). Stricter requirements for PAAs' role and
responsibilities are vital, including qualifications and membership of the EIA technical review
committee. Box 6 highlights other instances of such conflict of interest in Sri Lanka.

                      Box 6: Development versus Environmental Regulation, Sri Lanka
In 1992, the Ministry of Highways evaluated the environmental impact assessment of the Colombo­
Katunayake Expressway Project, which was proposed by the Road Development Authority. Similar
conflict of interest took place when the PAA for the Upper Kotmale Hydropower Project proposed by the
CEB was its parent ministry, MOPE. The EIA for this project was shrouded in controversy. The PAA was
closely involved with project formulation, proposal writing, and seeking donor assistance. In a wider
sense, it was acting as the project proponent. The chief authority of the PAA, the secretary of MOPE,
discarded the findings of the technical evaluation committee and indeed canvassed for the project. The
CEA, however, did not concur with the approval. The PAA appealed to the President to overrule the
decision of the CEA. The approval process for the Upper Kotmale Hydropower Project was steeped in
controversy and finally led to civil society organizations taking legal action against the PAA.

56.     CEA, the coordinator and custodian agency of the EIA process in Sri Lanka, suffers from
capacity and resource constraints. It administers most of the project EIAs in the country. The
PAAs in several instances have declined to take up the administration of the EIAs citing
resource constraints. Staff at the EIA division of CEA end up administering EIAs way beyond
their capacity, leading to delays in EIA approval and consequently to delays in the overall
project cycle. CEA then ends up being criticized for such delays, further eroding the credibility of
the government machinery and its ability to influence development. The ability of CEA, and in
particular of its EIA division, to undertake activities in the provinces is also severely limited, as it
does not have a dedicated staff pool in the provinces to work on EIA-related matters.16 The
TORs written for EIAs, reviewed and approved by CEA, are seen as too generic and large in
scope. Wide TORs result in EIAs that do not identify core issues and take a long time to finalize
and get approved, adding to the cost of the project rather than adding value to the process.


16
     With the exception of the North Western Province, the capacity of provincial councils to implement environmental
     functions is severely limited. The North-West Province Statute 12 of 1990 gives the provincial environmental
     authority the powers and functions of an environmental agency for the province, much like the powers of CEA in
     the rest of the country. This devolution of environmental functions has been successful in North-West Province, but
     largely due to the leadership demonstrated by the current director of the authority. It remains to be seen how
     enduring this success story is in the event of a leadership change.
                                                                                                    19


57.     Data management is another weak link in EIA development in Sri Lanka. EIAs do not
necessarily share primary data, which results in users not benefiting from that information and
analysis; nor is the data subjected to wider scrutiny that could avoid duplication, additional cost,
and delays. An EIA is only as good as the data used in developing it. No protocols or code of
ethics and/or conduct have been formulated and agreed for a national data-management
infrastructure. As a result, there is little trust and clarity on data sharing among the scientific and
consulting community and government establishments. A related problem is that of
environmental quality standards. For instance, the Department of Geology and Mines uses
environmental standards that differ from those of the CEA.

58.     Not all issues with Sri Lanka's environment system can be attributed to the EIA TA, and
the time elapsed since TA completion (12 years) should be considered, but the intended
outcome of a strengthened EIA process at CEA, PAAs, and provincial councils still remains
elusive. In light of this, the EIA TA can only be rated less effective.

59.     In contrast, the ESD TA in Sri Lanka had the privilege of being supported by an
investment project that had the attention of the beneficiary, RDA. Establishing and resourcing
ESD was a requirement of the loan and the TA. ESD has 23 staff, including 13 new graduates.
ESD management is currently undertaking a human resource development review to ensure
that ESD staff is suitably integrated into the wider ESD planning process. Since TA
implementation, ESD has carried out IEE­EIAs for projects totaling 2,400 kilometers of road
development. Continuity in training was also provided through an ongoing small-scale Sri Lanka
TA--Strengthening RDA in Implementation of the Environmental Management Plan of the
Southern Transport Development Project--and the World Bank-supported road sector
assistance project. The ESD team makes good use of manuals and guidelines produced under
the TA for development of EIAs and resettlement planning documents. The management
information system set up with TA funding has been effectively used in locating environmental
and natural resources that need to be safeguarded when considering road development in an
area. However, more work is required to fully digitize all the necessary land acquisition data.
Also, a view was expressed that the TA duration was too short to effectively integrate post-
construction environmental monitoring into the project planning activities of ESD/RDA. The TA
is thus rated effective.

60.      The above discussion lends itself to the unsurprising premise that the more focused and
targeted the TA design to the needs of the executing agency and, more importantly, of the
audience it caters to (e.g., financial institutions in the case of component D of the environmental
management TA in India, local and municipal councils in the CDM TA, or provincial councils in
the EIA TA in Sri Lanka), the higher the probability that outcomes will stand some chance of
attribution. Outcomes are sustained not so much by the executing or implementing agencies,
but in most cases by the end client, i.e., a financial institution in India (for component D) or a
local council in Andhra Pradesh for the CDM TA or a provincial environmental authority for the
Sri Lanka EIA TA.

D.     Efficiency

61.     The efficiency of the TA projects was assessed on how well the TA resources were used
in achieving the outcome, including on-time and on-budget performance, ADB supervision, and
counterpart arrangements. All the TA projects were completed within the funds made available,
but the completion of all projects were delayed.

62.      ADB struggled to implement the environmental management TA cluster from the start.
Initial delays in TA mobilization were a result of lengthy discussions with MOEF on its
20


coordinating role as the TA executing agency.17 The TA coordinator, who was to play a crucial
part in TA implementation, was recruited only in 2003 (instead of 2000 as originally planned)
pending agreement on implementation arrangements. Even when appointed, the TA coordinator
was a consultant and not an ADB staff; hence, lacked full decision-making authority. Likewise,
the TA steering committee was set up in 2003, 3 years later than originally intended.18 In the
absence of firm steering and a sense of direction during the original implementation period
(2000­2002), the consultants, executing agency, and implementing agencies operated in a
vacuum and in relative isolation from each other. At the end of 2002 and in early 2003,
i.e., 6 months after the original completion date of 31 August 2002, components A, C, and D
had produced a draft final report. Components B and E had not begun and fact-finding was
being scheduled. The outputs produced had not been approved by the executing and
implementing agencies on grounds of quality. No ADB officer at headquarters was responsible
for the overall cluster until March 2003, when TA administration was transferred to the India
Resident Mission. Field presence in India for continued and intensive discussions, not only with
the states, but also MOEF, was critical given the number of actors in the cluster TA, but did not
happen until 3 years after TA approval. A delay of 58 months in TA completion, cancellation of
an entire component accounting for a fourth of the TA budget, change of an implementation
agency, replacement of a team leader, performance issues with consultants--when taken
together and assessed in the context of an investment of $3.6 million and against the outputs
achieved, it warrants an inefficient rating. Box 7 illustrates some of the prevailing challenges to
the EIA system in India. Discussion on efficiency for each component is provided in Appendix 3.

             Box 7: Challenges to the Environmental Impact Assessment System in India
 Screening and scoping. Both impact and size of project important to define scope, screening

 guidelines do not specify need for a rapid EIA, and analysis of alternatives needs to improve.

 Baseline data. Difficult to secure good quality data for EIA, sampling and analysis procedures should be

 improved, and a centralized databank created. 

 Application of evaluation and predictive tools. Modeling often not suitable for local conditions.

 Hence, accuracy of predictions becomes questionable; little consideration given to cumulative impacts. 

 Monitoring. EMPs need more details, role and budget allocation, and monitoring responsibility. 

 Public participation. Needs to be done at each milestone of EIA development, with all relevant details 

 made available to the stakeholders. 

 Quality of EIA reports. Can be improved from being just a collection and compilation of data, as most 

 tend to be, and interpretation and analysis need to improve. 

 EIA = environmental impact assessment, EMP = environmental monitoring plan.

63.    Considering the modest scale of the CDM TA, its outputs were achieved at a relatively
low cost. The TA seems to have benefited from good donor coordination in building MOEF's

   The TA letter was signed by the government on 14 August 2000, shifting the TA start date by about 6 months after
   TA approval. A TA review mission visited India during 10­13 October 2000 to reconfirm scope and implementation
   arrangements of the cluster TA, and resolve lengthy discussions on the selection of consultants for component A;
   the first consultants were not fielded until February 2001 (Source: Back-to-Office Report, January 2003).

CDM India, the designated national authority for the India program. A previous UNDP19 study on
CDM and cofinancing from the Canadian International Development Agency through the
Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate Change contributed to the development of the TA.
However, the TA experienced delays in the beginning, because signing of the TA agreement
was delayed, and during implementation for want of active support from project developers and
because administration responsibility for the project was reassigned within ADB. The TA had a
very ambitious timeline, and it turned out that an extension was required to complete the work.
The TA's work program could have better anticipated some delays; for instance, the decision to
launch a public call for project proposals among municipalities and exchange of information with
the selected project promoters led to a much longer process than envisaged. All of this resulted
in more than a year's delay in completing the TA activities. Overall, the TA was less efficient.

64.     The EIA TA in Sri Lanka was, for the most part, delivered efficiently. The TA built on
previous donor assistance--the USAID-funded NAREPP--and during implementation worked
closely with the World Bank-funded EA1P and the UNDP (para. 24). Ownership from MTEWA
and CEA was strong. However, collaboration with the provincial authorities and councils could
have been better. TA implementation was extended by 2 months to allow for additional
workshops requested by the executing agency. Consultants who had experience in working with
MTEWA and CEA under NAREPP ensured immediate action once the TA mobilized and were
appreciated by the executing agency. Overall, the TA was efficient, having produced the outputs
in a timely and a cost-effective manner.

65.     The signing of the TA agreement on the ESD TA was delayed because RDA had not set
up the ESD, which was a condition for the TA. Barring the replacement of the social safeguard
specialist because of illness, consulting inputs were delivered efficiently. The TA, however,
experienced delays and the completion date was extended on three different occasions. These
extensions were necessary to allow the RDA board to finalize and then approve the operation
manuals. Although the consultant inputs had been completed in June 2008 (still a year later
than originally planned) and getting approval of the various manuals and outputs from RDA
seemed a simple enough task, it appears that the internal government machinery did take time
in granting such approvals, which delayed TA completion by almost 2 years (the final
manuscript of the safeguards manual was forwarded to the Transport and Communications
Division of the South Asia Department on 30 July 2009), rendering the TA less efficient.

66.     It is interesting to see that of the four TA projects discussed above for efficient and timely
completion of activities, only the EIA TA met the mark, even though it was implemented at the
height of the civil conflict in Sri Lanka and yet seems to have survived any interruptions to its
delivery. Other TA projects were marred by delays either on account of ADB staff changes,
consultant replacement, protracted discussions on scope and implementation arrangements
with executing agencies, or delays in securing approvals to reports.

E.         Sustainability

67.    Unlike the other pillars of evaluation discussed earlier, sustainability is frequently
affected by external factors that may be beyond the TA project's influence. The allocation of
human, institutional, and financial resources toward sustaining a TA outcome is in the purview
19
     UNDP has been working closely with the Government of India in various strategic areas of development
     interventions. As one of the implementing agencies of the Global Environment Facility, UNDP is contributing to
     resource mobilization for addressing global environment issues. CDM is an important and innovative international
     financial cooperation mechanism that can play a significant role in mitigating climate change and promoting
     sustainable development in the long run. UNDP seeks primarily to contribute to an effort to mobilize and leverage
     additional CDM resources that help advance rural development and poverty reduction.
22


of the government agency that receives the assistance. ADB's ability to continually influence
and engage that agency's interest in the TA goals and objectives is limited.

68.     The environmental management TA was not able to foster the relationships and
collaborative mechanisms between SPCB and MOEF that were intended by the cluster design,
due to the federal nature of the subject in India and its environmental governance relationships.
In that respect, the outputs produced by the TA across the various components only ever had a
chance of being useful to their immediate audience within the state, and there was never a
centralized or coordinated push from any central or state agency to try to disseminate any of the
outputs or intended outcomes at a regional or national level. Only on one occasion did all
SPCBs come together as part of activity 3--"National Colloquium on Strategic Planning for Top
Management of Central Pollution Control Board and 18 SPCBs"--which was a one-off event.
The TA was thus not able to develop and harness synergies across components and states, a
key purpose of its cluster approach. Other avenues such as mainstreaming some of the TA
outcomes into the training course of the Indian Administrative Services and India's Annual State
of Environment, as envisaged in the TA scope, never materialized. In the absence of a platform
that could disseminate the TA outputs to a larger audience, it was always going to be difficult to
argue for resources to be allocated for sustaining the TA outcomes. In view of this, sustainability
of outcomes is seen as less likely from an overall cluster perspective. Discussion on
sustainability for each component is provided in Appendix 3.

69.      The CDM TA was the first step in raising awareness on the subject and building capacity
for it at municipal and local levels, and brought together stakeholders, financial institutions, and
government staff on a common platform. Nonetheless, raising finance for CDM still remains a
challenge. The full potential of CDM among SMEs is still to be realized. While the PDD
formulation and awareness-building objectives of the TA effectively targeted local and municipal
bodies, the TA project's scope was insufficient to decisively influence CDM development at the
national level. For that to happen, other preconditions such as the readiness of the financial
sector to accommodate the projects' CDM revenue realization potential (rather than continuing
to lend strictly on the basis of project developers' balance sheets) would need to be satisfied.
Progress here, crucially reliant on the quality of emission reduction certification and registration,
has been modest, suggesting perhaps the direction of a desirable follow-up TA to India. On
balance, the direction promoted by the TA is considered less likely sustainable.

70.     Sri Lanka has just emerged from a long and expensive civil conflict that undoubtedly had
a huge impact on the country's financial and human resources. This period of bloody conflict
has led some of its best talent to migrate to other countries, and a process of nation building has
to occur now. While there will be a big emphasis on infrastructure development as a driver of
economic growth, it will be unwise to do so without appropriate regard to environment and social
safeguards. Both time and circumstances have affected the EIA system in the country, and
there is a need for a fresh push on all fronts of environmental management. Sustainability of the
EIA TA outcomes is less likely under the prevailing weaknesses in the system of EIA
governance in Sri Lanka. Urgent work is required in the area of:
        (i)  Capacity development of CEA's EIA division with new sector-specific EIA
               guidelines, including details on how to conduct and write an environmental
               monitoring and management plan;
        (ii)  Capacity development of environment units in key PAAs, including review of
               "Guidance for Implementing the EIA Process No. 1: General Guide for PAAs;"
        (iii)  Review of the National Environment Act to strengthen provisions for the roles
               and responsibility of PAAs, including clear stipulations on how to avoid conflict of
                                                                                                    23


                interest situations, the EIA technical review committees, and qualifications for
                EIA writers and reviewers that encompass a process of accreditation; and
       (iv)     Legal provisions for undertaking SEA for complex and multisector regional
                investments.

71.    Box 8 summarizes some of the issues with weak enforcement of EIA in Sri Lanka.

                   Box 8: Lack of Resources Bring Weak Enforcement, Sri Lanka

No single administrator is capable of handling all aspects of the EIA process. However, most PAAs have
only one person to attend to EIAs and that alongside numerous other tasks. Apart from the Board of
Investment, which has a separate environment department and a laboratory of its own, PAAs clearly have
a staffing problem and lack other resource. Even CEA, the competent authority on EIA in Sri Lanka, has
only 18 officers allocated to the EIA division. Most EIAs are triggered by the NEA and end up with CEA,
which in view of the present resource base has difficulty accommodating more intensive monitoring and
compliance inspection. Decentralizing CEA functions by setting up regional offices has eased the burden
on CEA to some extent, but streamlining post-EIA monitoring responsibilities to DEOs has not been
effective at all. Reorganizing DEOs' workload will allow their involvement in post-EIA monitoring.

CEA = Central Environment Authority, DEO = divisional environmental officer, EIA = environmental impact

assessment, NEA = Nepal Electricity Authority, PAA = project-approving agency.

72.     The ESD TA enables RDA to be a role model for other PAAs in Sri Lanka on how to
undertake development with adequate environmental and social safeguards. Having
successfully prepared IEEs and EIAs for road works totaling 2,400 kilometers by using the skills
obtained in the TA and the post-conflict impetus on road development in Sri Lanka, combined
with the commitment demonstrated by RDA management to the development of ESD, the TA's
direction is likely to be sustainable.

                                 IV.     OTHER ASSESSMENTS

A.     Impact

73.      None of the TA projects evaluated had an impact statement in its framework, so the
evaluation of impact is done against the sector-specific goals described in the TA frameworks
(or in the National Highways Project framework for the ESD TA).

74.     The impact of the environmental management TA in India is rated moderate. The goal of
the TA cluster was to stimulate and facilitate environmentally sound development. The goal was
generic and far too broad, and not very useful for assessing the impact of the overall cluster. As
written, the TA does not specify if the goal was to promote or influence environmentally sound
development across India or just in the states targeted for TA. From an overall cluster
perspective, Box 7 summarizes the challenges that still confront smooth conduct of the EIA
process in India. While those cannot be attributed to the environmental management TA,
previous discussion leads us to conclude that planned TA outcomes have not greatly influenced
the environmental strides that MOEF has made in the past 10 years. Given India's high
population density, vulnerable ecology, extreme climate, and a significant share of the economy
heavily reliant on natural resources, environmental sustainability remains a challenge on the
country's development path, adding to the list of priority needs of reducing disparity, eliminating
poverty, and promoting social cohesion. Despite a strong policy and institutional framework and
some successes, environmental degradation has not been arrested on a large scale. The
24


countrywide average compliance ratio for monitored industries (falling far short of all polluting
sources) is at only 50%. Furthermore, the trends in environmental quality indicators are mixed.
For example, urban air quality (measured as suspended particular matter of less than
10 microns) has been improving in the largest cities, such as Delhi and Mumbai, where
significant efforts have been made to control multiple pollution sources, but has deteriorated in
many other cities. While the capacity of MOEF, and the national and state pollution control
boards has improved over time, keeping up with the challenges of rapid growth has proved
difficult.20 India is a large and complex development space and any intervention, externally
funded or otherwise, requires sustained effort on the part of the government and civil society to
achieve success. Significant segments of the population have other more pressing priorities.
Political commitment to environmental improvement still varies by state and constituency,
particularly when measured against multiple competing needs. In light of the complexity that
surrounds both development and environmental management in India, the overall TA cluster
impact is rated moderate.

75.      The impact of the CDM TA in India is rated moderate. India is the second top source of
certified emission reductions (CERs) in the United Nation's CDM, after the PRC. According to
UNFCCC data, India has 498 CDM projects registered to date. In total, 78.2 million CERs
(currently worth $1.24 billion) have been issued to Indian projects, representing 19.6% of all
CERs issued globally to date. CDM India, the designated national authority, recognizes the
contribution made by the CDM TA as evidenced from information contained on its website.21
However, challenges still remain in the municipal and local sectors both in urban and rural
areas, the focus of the TA activities. Most progress has been achieved in the power generation,
waste management, and cement manufacturing sectors. Emphasis is growing in the local
municipal sectors, and the real impact of the TA will be known in years to come.

76.     While reasonably well structured and efficiently implemented, the impact of the EIA TA in
Sri Lanka can be rated moderate at best. Prolonged civil conflict and the strain it caused on
national resources may have affected the capacity of not only the EIA TA but also of other
internationally financed assistance in the country. As the country recovers and deliberates its
development priorities, one hopes that CEA, PAAs, and provincial authorities will adopt some of
the principles of integrating environmental decision making into project development. In an
encouraging sign, SEA (a key initiative of the EIA TA) is now being considered for development
projects in northern and eastern provinces.

77.     The impact of the ESD TA can be termed significant, certainly in the short term, given its
contribution toward setting up ESD and equipping its staff with necessary skills and resources to
establish and then implement the institution's environmental and social management mandate.
The TA, along with other related actions taken by ADB and the government (implementation of
the Southern Transport TA, a thorough review of LAR compliance arrangements, etc.), made
genuine advances in the approaches to and mechanisms of dealing with otherwise thorny
issues of land acquisition and involuntary settlement in Sri Lanka. Time will tell how serious
RDA remains in keeping ESD as strong and independent in the delivery of its safeguard
function.

B.     ADB Performance

78.     ADB struggled to implement the cluster environmental management TA, partly a result of
an ambitious design that underestimated the complex implementation arrangements of an
interstate TA in India, its strong institutional divisions and federal nature, and divergent
development priorities of each state. Key problems were (i) the lack of a single point of contact
or coordination function within ADB across the components (as originally envisaged for the TA
coordinator, who was not recruited for 3 years); (ii) late involvement of the India Resident
Mission--affected by ADB's 2002 reorganization, which disbanded the Office of Environment
and Social Development, the original parent of the TA, and transferred its responsibilities to the
successor Environment and Safeguards Division of the Regional and Sustainable Development
Department; (iii) failure to anticipate and correct swiftly the performance issues related to
consultants on components A and C; and (iv) a design that was far too broad and risked running
astray in the absence of firm steering. Run astray it did, although the broad scope of the TA, as
enunciated in the TA paper, was to come to its rescue toward the end through the formulation of
additional activities. Broad TOR led to production of too many outputs, most of which found few
audiences. The TA framework could have been better designed by incorporating alerts that
would stem TA decline and trigger corrective actions.

79.     In summary, ADB deserves high marks for stamina and dogged pursuit of an honorable
outcome. Even if the TA was unsuccessful, ADB has not lost credibility; it is considered a
serious and steady partner by both the Ministry of Finance and MOEF. Performance, on
balance and when considered over the 7-year implementation, can be rated at best less than
satisfactory.

80.     ADB's performance was satisfactory in the CDM TA in India. Formulation for the most
part was good and ADB collaborated very well with the Climate Change Division of MOEF,
invoking strong response from the counterpart staff. Barring one change in TA management
during the course of the TA due to the transfer of an official, ADB staffing arrangements and
supervision were suitable, although more supervising missions would have been desirable when
the project was delayed for lack of response to a public call for expressions of interest on PDDs.
ADB collaborated with UNDP and the Canadian International Development Agency in
developing the scope of the TA, demonstrating efficient donor coordination. Timely discussions
with Canada's Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation Office prevented
possible duplication with the World Bank's Carbon Finance-Assist Program in India.

81.     ADB's performance on both TA projects in Sri Lanka was satisfactory. Formulation was
effective and collaborative, although more effort could have been directed at provincial
authorities and PAA association would have been more effective in a pilot approach. Donor
coordination was adequate, especially in the EIA TA, for which the TORs were developed in
coordination with USAID and the World Bank. Smooth EIA implementation requires governance
reform on a larger scale larger than was feasible under the TA, as the government would have
to adopt wide-ranging administrative reforms aimed at simplifying procedures and approvals,
while providing proper checks and balances in the system.

C.     Executing Agency and Implementing Agency Performance

82.      Implementation arrangements as designed for the environmental management TA
cluster became a constraining factor for MOEF to provide efficient support to the cluster. MOEF
has little administrative oversight over the SPCBs who were the implementing agencies. The
different delivery modalities between ADB's cluster TA and that of the ongoing World Bank
26


EMCBP may have affected TA implementation arrangements in MOEF. The World Bank TA
provided greater latitude and freedom to MOEF manifesting in what would seem to be greater
ownership. Absence of the TA coordinator based locally at the India Resident Mission 3 years
into implementation did not help the situation either, someone who could have maintained close
day-to-day relationship with MOEF addressing their concerns on an urgent basis would have
been very useful. Change in MOEF's TA manager from design to implementation phase also
caused some discontinuity in relationship; mainly as a result of shortcomings in the
implementation arrangements that resulted in intermittent loss of focus and disenfranchising the
executing agency resulting in a performance that is rated less than satisfactory.

83.    The performance of the implementing agencies varied from less than satisfactory (for
components A and D) to satisfactory (for components C and E). These ratings reflect the
circumstances in which these agencies found themselves as described below. Overall, the
executing agency performance is assessed partly satisfactory.
       (i)    Component A. Lack of clarity between the objectives of component A and those
              of the ongoing World Bank-funded EMCBP, coupled with the long-term capacity-
              building relationship that MOEF enjoyed with the World Bank (through projects
              such as Sardar Sarovar in the 1980s, the environment action plan in 1993, and
              the EMCBP in 1997­2004), relegated component A to a status where it operated
              more or less in isolation. The performance of consultants and the removal of the
              team leader by the contracted consulting company without reference to MOEF
              also became a cause of discontentment and further alienated MOEF and its buy-
              in of the component products.
       (ii)   Component B. GPCB's performance should not be judged by the cancellation of
              the component alone. The EMI was already established when the TA was
              approved, and by the time both parties could reach agreement on a revised
              scope, other events dominated the period in which the component had to be
              delivered. The implementing agency's performance could not be evaluated since
              the component was cancelled.
       (iii)  Component C. A change in TA management at MPPCB earlier in the life of the
              component affected its ownership of the longer-term utility of the outputs and
              required a revision at the draft final report stage. While commitment from MPPCB
              was unflinching, the component suffered from performance issues with the
              consultant that affected the timeliness of the outputs and wider engagement with
              the stakeholders including with ADB. The situation only improved when the
              additional geographic information system activity was introduced, which led to a
              significant level of enthusiasm from MPPCB officials.
       (iv)   Component D. The change of implementing agency from the National
              Productivity Council to MOEF was more a result of shortcomings during TA fact-
              finding than anything else. Picking MOEF as a replacement was not a good
              choice, and it was incumbent on ADB to work with MOEF to find an appropriate
              implementing agency before proceeding with the component. MOEF, which was
              already the executing agency for the overall cluster and the implementing agency
              for component A, did not have sufficient resources at its disposal, or could
              mobilize any, to discharge the responsibility effectively.
       (v)    Component E. Unlike other implementing agencies, WBPCB took its time in
              understanding the objectives of the cluster and only agreed to start the TA once
              the scope was finalized to its satisfaction. This delay turned out to be a blessing
              in disguise, as all three parties--ADB, WBPCB (including Institute of
              Environmental Studies and Wetland Management), and the consultants--
                                                                                                 27


               operated from the same page. Outputs were produced on time and with
               ownership from WBPCB and continue to find passionate support to this day.

84.     The performance of MOEF is rated satisfactory on the CDM TA. The Climate Change
Division of MOEF has been committed to the objectives of the TA throughout, and is a valuable
supporter of the TA's intended outcomes with CDM India. TA outputs continue to be
disseminated and promoted with financial support from the ministry, and MOEF expressed to
the IEM the need for a follow-up TA (para. 69), indicating its willingness to continue the
cooperation.

85.      The performance of the executing agencies for the two TA projects in Sri Lanka was
satisfactory. Both the Ministry of Environment and the RDA supported the respective TA
projects in garnering adequate local stakeholder attention for these initiatives supporting USAID,
ADB, and the World Bank in the trilogy of EIA assistance (para. 64). This rating has even
greater significance when seen in the light of the executing agencies' contribution during a very
difficult period for Sri Lanka, when government had to balance the need to invest into
environment protection with the need to fight the internal civil conflict. It is another matter that
the EIA process requires rejuvenation and further capacity strengthening in the aftermath of the
war.

                                     V.      KEY FINDINGS

86.     This section highlights some of the shared and individual features observed in evaluating
the four case studies (Appendixes 3­6) and the six desk review (Appendix 7) TA projects.

87.      Start-up delays affected all the TA projects. Start-up delays of between 6 and
10 months were experienced by all the TA projects. This is too long and in most cases reflects
administrative and approval processes rather than force-majeure events or other extraneous
factors. The delays usually affect subsequent implementation and invariably lower TA efficiency.
Despite the knowledge that ADB was unable to influence that process directly, TA design
(timing, fielding of consultants, disbursement, etc.) did not anticipate and suitably counter these
initial delays, and possibly build in financial incentives into TA financing that reward speedy
action.

88.    Continuity of personnel and ownership affected implementation. TA ownership by
ADB and the executing agency becomes a critical element in generating desired outcomes and
sustaining them. Ownership is best achieved when those responsible for TA design both within
ADB and DMC, are at least involved in the launching of TA activities and preferably stay
involved throughout the TA's life. It is desirable to work with a wider cross-section of officials
and stakeholders in the executing agency, making it easier to anchor the TA in the executing
agency's development agenda and ensure effective counterpart support. Both TA projects in
India underwent staff changes at ADB, and the environmental management TA had to go
through significant staff changes at the implementing agencies as well.

89.     Donor coordination was an important element of TA delivery. Close donor
coordination has an impact on TA performance. This was demonstrated on more than one
occasion in the TA projects evaluated here. The environmental management TA in India
overlapped with a similar project of the World Bank and with other government-funded initiatives
both during implementation and after. In part because of it, the effectiveness of ADB's TA
suffered. No evidence could be found in the documents reviewed for the cluster TA that an effort
was made to hold joint workshops or seminars with the World Bank to disseminate findings and
28


crystallize synergies for the benefit of the national audience. The EIA TA in Sri Lanka admittedly
did a better job of donor coordination, as did the CDM TA in India. In the latter's case, timely
discussions with Canada's Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation Office
prevented possible duplication with the World Bank's Carbon Finance-Assist Program in India.

90.     Enabling conditions to convert TA outputs to a useful outcome were absent. All
the TA projects produced several outputs of good quality. What was missing, however, were the
conditions that would turn them into useful products, the exception being the ESD TA in Sri
Lanka, which had the enabling environment. Several components of the environmental
management TA in India were not able to address this. Component D's end audience were the
SMEs and the financial institutions, but the component did not succeed in bringing them
together effectively on its outputs. This raises the importance of targeting the right beneficiaries.
Outcomes are sustained not so much by the executing or implementing agencies but in most
cases by their end clients, such as the financial institutions in India (for component D) or a local
council in Andhra Pradesh (for the CDM TA), or a provincial environmental authority (for the Sri
Lanka EIA TA). Most consultants for the cluster TA spent their time trying to gather information
to prepare reports, and little time engaging with MOEF (for component A) or MPPCB (for
component C) on the design of such outputs and tailoring the advice accordingly. Consequently,
the TA generated minimal outcomes and impact.

91.      Collaboration between central and provincial environmental agencies could have
been improved by the TA. The TA projects were not able to promote and encourage greater
collaboration between central and state or provincial environmental agencies. In India, for the
environmental management TA, the federal nature of environmental governance affected
meaningful coordination between MOEF and SPCBs. In Sri Lanka, lack of an enabling statute
for the provinces meant the authority for EIA approvals remained vested in CEA. The prevailing
legislative framework in both countries undermined the potential of the two TA projects to
develop center­state partnerships on environmental management. These were missed
opportunities.

92.     Country safeguards systems. The environmental management TA in India and the EIA
TA in Sri Lanka contributed to the evolution of the CSS in their countries. While more work is
required to bring the safeguard systems in both countries fully in line with international good
practice, both TA projects evaluated here supported the development of modern EIA tools and
techniques, and their use in national environmental management. The Environment and
Safeguards Division of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department of ADB is
undertaking a regional TA on strengthening CSS for India.22 The contribution of the evaluated
TA projects to further development of their countries' CSS can be summarized as follows:
        (i)    Environmental management TA (India). The work undertaken by the TA made
               some contributions to the development of the revised EIA Notification for 2006.23
               In particular, activities relating to EIA preparation and review, environmental data
               management and use for development of EIAs, promotion of SEA, and
               associated training workshops were all pertinent to building MOEF's capacity to
               work with the 2006 Notification. Component A's work on EIA procedures and
               practices, including screening, emphasis on scoping, and requirements for public

   It should be acknowledged that lead work in this regard was undertaken by the Govindarajan Committee on
   investment reform in 2001 by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute on a guidance manual for
   EIA of development projects in 2003, and by the Environmental Resources Management under the World Bank's
   EMCBP on environmental clearances in 2003.
                                                                                                                 29


                 hearing, were all aspects of EIA that are reflected in the 2006 Notification. In
                 addition, activities undertaken to build the National Highway Authority of India's
                 environmental management systems critical for EIA of road projects helped
                 strengthen EIA systems at agency level.
        (ii)     Institutional strengthening for EIA (Sri Lanka). The EIA TA was an important
                 link in the series of EIA-related assistance provided to the country by ADB,
                 USAID, and the World Bank toward reform and strengthening of the EIA system.
                 The EIA TA redressed important institutional reform issues for CEA and PAAs,
                 including better interagency coordination and stronger environment units within
                 PAAs, and introduced the concept of SEA, which has now become an important
                 tool for environmentally sound regional planning. The TA upgraded the
                 computerized databases at CEA to include an EIA process management and
                 tracking system, and developed a database for EIA professionals. While all this
                 work was carried out at the time of TA implementation, it is unfortunate that there
                 was little follow-up, certainly not an effective one; and the EIA system in Sri
                 Lanka needs a new lease of life to bring it to the forefront of development
                 planning. Similarly, despite understandable concerns about insufficiently
                 developed EIA procedures and skills, fundamental problems of environmental
                 governance must not be overlooked, e.g., the question of conflict of interest for
                 certain PAAs and the lack of environmental data sharing between organizations.
                 The EIA TA was aware of these problems, but allowed them to take second
                 stage to other items on the busy TA agenda.

93.     No follow-up work was undertaken. None of the TA projects had any significant
follow-up. This resulted in a loss of momentum, poor uptake of the outputs that were produced,
and consequently few to no outcomes. In the environmental management TA in India, for
instance, there was no significant follow-up from ADB, MOEF, or the SPCBs to build on the
action blueprint developed for ESP promotion, whether through information sharing, capacity
building, policies and regulations, or financing.24 The PDDs for small-scale rural sector projects
developed under the CDM TA were not validated and registered. The importance of follow-up
TA was highlighted in the self-evaluation reports of most TA projects studied for this TPER,
including those in the other countries of South Asia studied in Appendix 7.

94.      Based on the evaluation findings, this para. provides ideas on several follow-up
opportunities for future TA. Especially the CDM TA in India and the EIA TA in Sri Lanka present
the following opportunities:
         (i)   A TA for supporting an India CDM fund through ADB's carbon market initiative;
               also consider applying the PRC experience (especially the Support for
               Establishing CDM Fund TA) to India.25
         (ii)  A TA for training managers of municipal services and city officials in the design
               and administration of CDM projects, with a focus on waste management projects
               such as landfill gas recovery and use, waste-to-energy conversion activities, and
               composting from municipal organic waste, which are particularly attractive for
               Indian conditions. The TA, if delivered on the back of a demonstration project,

24
   The Government of West Bengal's recommendation for the World Bank to consider support for EMI in West Bengal
   (component E, additional activity) did not evoke any response due to deferment of the relevant World Bank project.
   Likewise, the World Bank-sponsored EA1P, which continued after the EIA TA was completed, did not address
   some of the issues identified in the TA, such as legislating SEA, a more targeted approach to strengthening
   environment units in PAAs, or greater delegation of environmental functions to provincial authorities.

                   particularly one that enhances existing CDM methodologies, could encourage the
                   development of small-scale CDM sector.
           (iii)   A TA for the next stage of EIA reforms in Sri Lanka, encompassing (a) a clearer
                   definition of roles and responsibility of CEA including its provincial offices, PAAs,
                   provincial environment authorities, and EIA technical review committees
                   (including removal of PAAs from an EIA function where potential for conflict of
                   interest exists); (b) training for better IEE and EIA, including environmental
                   management and monitoring plans; (c) legislation to introduce SEA as a
                   mandatory tool for large regional projects with potential for cumulative impacts;
                   and (d) enactment of statutes where appropriate granting provincial environment
                   authorities responsibility for conducting the EIA process. ADB should collaborate
                   with the World Bank on this initiative which has already commenced work on the
                   subject.26

                   will allow time-efficient sharing of information on environmental and natural
                   resource issues across countries of South Asia. This will (a) increase the
                   capacity of national governments to make informed decisions on sustainable
                   development, enhance the availability and accessibility of environmental and
                   natural resource data to national government agencies, regional organizations,
                   and the international community; (b) and establish a subregional information
                   exchange network, covering a basic, uniform, and compatible data set, and an
                   early warning system for environmental management.

                       VI.      ISSUES, LESSONS, AND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

A.         Lessons for Environment Capacity Development Technical Assistance

95.      Environmental agencies need long-term sustained assistance. ADB has
successfully used the TA instrument to build capacity of a project management unit or an
implementing agency, with a view to bolster their project management skills, including
environmental and social safeguards. In India, for instance, ADB's TA strategy in the
environment sector was to strengthen the capacity of line agencies to prepare the EIA of ADB-
financed projects (Appendix 3, para. 16). While this protects ADB's investment in the short term
from potential negative environmental or social impact, it may not succeed in developing
environmental management capacity of national or provincial scale. National environment
agencies mandated to regulate environmental issues and provide guidance to government have
to stay abreast of the latest advances in environment technology, which may not be an easy
task for an environment agency in a DMC given the competing demand on limited financial
resources. If an external donor agency is the primary source of such assistance, a
programmatic approach to building national or provincial environmental management capacity--
a long-term process that will assist sustained capacity development and where each
intervention is part of a longer-term reform agenda--stands a better chance of success than an
isolated TA. This is particularly relevant in countries that are undergoing substantial policy and
institutional change, e.g., in the aftermath of a conflict.

96.    Sector-specific environment capacity development stands a better chance of
success if associated with a project or a program. Environment-strengthening TA that is
associated with infrastructure lending can be more effective in achieving reform of
environmental practices if loan tranches are linked to progress on the environmental TA

project's milestones. Such incentives are difficult to build into a stand-alone advisory or
capacity-development TA that is considered purely a knowledge product. Activities that are seen
to produce a quick and tangible result, e.g., an environmentally compliant or proficient road or
power plant, add more value to the sector's oversight agency than a TA that is only advisory in
nature and runs the risk of losing relevance once that advice ceases.

97.    Municipal CDM projects have long-term development benefits. Although complex in
nature due to scale and multitude of stakeholder involvement, development benefits of
municipal CDM projects are numerous including an opportunity to boost local economic
development inclusive of environmental, economic and financial, and social benefits. Waste
management, in particular, if undertaken under the envelope of CDM, may kill two birds with
one stone--not only does it solve the issue of municipal solid waste, it also attracts financing,
because a CDM scheme greatly increases the appeal of a project compared with other project
types.

98.     Access to primary data is essential for robust environmental scrutiny. Lack of an
agreed data-sharing protocol is emerging as a major source of inefficiency in administering
environmental safeguards, because it leads to needless duplication and delays. It increases the
cost of the process, reduces its credibility, and imposes an unnecessary burden on the
regulated community. Credibility of an IEE or EIA is directly related to the quality of data used in
its preparation. In a number of cases, the data used to justify IEE or EIA conclusions are not
attached to the reports themselves and remain unavailable to third parties. While limited access
to certain types of natural resource data may be justified on the grounds of national security or
strategic considerations, large-scale de facto privatization or withholding of EIA-related data is
not in the public interest. The EIA process in Sri Lanka suffers from this problem.

99.     Decentralization of environmental assessment without adequate institutional
capacity at provincial levels leads to inefficiencies. Decentralization of environmental
assessment functions, accompanied with stronger local capacity, is the need of the hour in both
India and Sri Lanka. The recently introduced environmental clearance process (2006) by MOEF
in India enshrines decentralization of decision making at the state level. However, due to
varying levels of development in the states, is often hampered by limited capacity and skills in
scoping, preparing TOR, and reviewing EIAs at state environment departments, SPCBs, and
appraisal committees. In Sri Lanka, more enabling statutes need to be enacted where
appropriate, along the lines of North Western Province Environmental Statute 12 (1990), which
gave the North Western Provincial Environmental Authority the responsibility for the EIA
process in the province. Priority tasks under a possible further decentralization in Sri Lanka
include reforming the list of agencies recognized as PAAs to avoid conflict of interest, capacity
development of PAAs and provincial offices of CEA, clarifying the roles and responsibilities of
EIA technical review committees, and preparing EIA guidelines (including those for
environmental monitoring and management plans).

B.     Lessons for General Capacity Development Technical Assistance

100. Unduly broad TORs tend to weaken TA focus. A TA with a very large canvas ends up
becoming irrelevant sooner rather than later. Overly broad TOR tend to hide an uncertain grasp
of key issues and rarely serves anyone's interest; broader is not necessarily better. The result is
excessive cost and duration of the project and a rising gap between the volume of consultant
outputs and the readiness of the client to use them; this is even more critical when the
absorptive capacity of the executing agency is weak. The environmental management cluster
TA in India with five components, four implementing agencies, and 157 person-months of
32


consulting inputs took more than 7 years to complete. This lesson supports a similar finding in
India's country assistance program evaluation, conducted in 2007--that effectiveness is greater
when assistance focuses on relatively few areas than when spread over multiple sectors and
states.

101. Shared responsibility for cluster TA management is ineffective. The environmental
management cluster TA in India has clearly demonstrated the importance of one ADB officer
managing the overall cluster instead of different officers being responsible for different
components. Involvement of different mission leaders in developing a cluster TA can well be
justified, but extending that approach to implementation is not. At that stage, the executing or
implementing agency should have only one ADB point of contact. Change of ADB's supervision
structure midway through implementation, as what happened in the CDM TA in India, will have
a detrimental impact on performance.

102. Infrequent dialogue with TA counterparts affects performance. Institutional reform is
a slow and demanding process, one that requires close partnership between ADB and the
executing agency, built on trust. Periodic supervision missions from ADB headquarters stand
less of a chance to generate that trust. Resident missions, on the other hand, are close to the
scene of action and can better appreciate the context and dig deeper into possible sources of
implementation difficulties. Limited field presence in the early days of the environmental
management TA for continued and intensive discussions, not only with the SPCBs but also
MOEF, was among the factors that hampered that project. This lesson supports a similar finding
in India's country assistance program evaluation of 2007--that greater delegation to the
resident mission will boost client responsiveness.

103. Absence of a mandate reduces the executing agency's efficacy in knowledge
transfer through the TA. Executing agencies are the flag bearers of the TA during and after its
completion, and they are expected to own the final product and then disseminate it effectively.
However, to do so they need the mandate, complementary institutional preconditions, and
necessary skills. In the absence of these, the transfer of know-how, expected of TA projects, will
not occur or will be seriously diminished, as was demonstrated in the financing cleaner
production component of the environmental management TA in India.

C.     Recommendations

104. The following recommendations are for consideration during the country partnership
strategy formulation in India and Sri Lanka.

105. Develop a programmatic approach to environment capacity-development TA.
Develop a pipeline of environment capacity-development TA projects, suitably sequenced to
support the country's sector road maps as part of the country partnership strategy planning. TA
designs should be guided by the goals and objectives of the sector road maps and have clearly
recognizable performance indicators. The road maps should refer to TA interventions with
critical paths for ensuring the effective timing and sequencing of interventions, including
proposed sources of funding. Greater participation from the government in designing such TA
programming should be entertained, with inputs on design and implementation arrangements.
Such a long-term programmatic approach to environmental TA to a state or province (or a group
of small provinces) would promote sustained capacity development, as each intervention is part
of a longer-term reform process.
                                                                                               33


106. Draw on ADB resident missions for design and implementation of environment
capacity-development TA and country safeguard systems. More use of ADB resident
mission staff should be considered both at design and implementation stages. Resident mission
staff is well positioned for building strong relationships with executing agencies and other local
stakeholders, and thus are better able to ensure ownership and continuity of TA outcomes.
Cluster TA projects with several national and subnational players, in particular, require constant
communication and attention to project design and implementation issues as they arise, and
resident missions are best placed to undertake this role. To the extent possible, the role of ADB
headquarters should be that of technical oversight and quality control of the TA. Other
measures to improve implementation are (i) retention of the same ADB TA officer from design
and formulation to implementation and closure, even if transferred to another department in
ADB; and (ii) including backup plans for likely changes in the senior ranks of executing and
implementing agencies, and arrangements that shield TA projects from a possible lapse in
commitment because of leadership change at the executing or implementing agencies.

107. Assist in building strong environmental governance to ensure transparent and
cost-effective TA outcomes. The present evaluation provided a valuable reminder of certain
basics of environmental safeguards, easily forgotten in the midst of calls for greater scope and
ambition of environmental and social assessments. These basics include (i) addressing conflicts
of interest where a government agency trained by ADB to conduct environmental and social
assessments may have a vested interest in approving, rather than questioning and even
rejecting projects; (ii) avoiding inefficiencies (and an unnecessarily high cost of environmental
compliance) caused by unsuitable TORs for IEEs and EIAs; and (iii) preventing the withholding
of primary data that makes it necessary to duplicate work. Reducing the cost of environmental
compliance while achieving its quality objectives should become an important topic for ADB,
now that the bases of the system have been created in most DMCs. This recommendation also
supports a key finding in Sri Lanka's country assistance program evaluation of 2007--improving
governance is crucial to making institutions more transparent and accountable, and less prone
to corruption.

          Most TA projects (with the exception of TA 7173-NEP and TA 7326-SRI) are either in mobilization or inception
          stages and a full evaluation is not justified at this stage. While early conclusions on "relevance" criteria of these TA
          projects can be made, a more accurate conclusion on "relevance" rating can only be considered when outputs
          have been produced and they show evidence of (i) accuracy with respect to intended outcomes, and
          (ii) participation of government ownership.

                 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL ­ INDIA

A.        Summary

1.      The technical assistance (TA) on Environmental Management at the State Level was an
ambitious attempt to sequentially strengthen environmental management at India's central and
state levels, and improve the coordination and sharing of experience across the central and
state environmental agencies.1 The TA consisted of five components, three of which were
implemented by state pollution control boards (in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal)
and two at the central level by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF). The design took
the form of a TA cluster and the project was large by Asian Development Bank (ADB) advisory
TA standards with a total budget of over $4.3 million, of which ADB financed over $3.6 million.

2.     The project was to be implemented in just over 2 years but took more than 7 years to
complete. After a slow start, marked by distant and ineffective supervision, ADB finally took
decisive steps early in 2003, including transfer of responsibility for the project to the India
Resident Mission, with a resident mission staff dedicated chiefly to the project, and appointment
of a TA coordinator. This, together with a series of adjustments to the TA's scope and
formulation of additional activities, helped avert the project's collapse.

3.      Spurred on by excessively broad terms of reference (TOR) under most components, the
project resulted in a very large number of outputs that far outstripped or missed the client's
needs. In retrospect, the project formulation was not backed by sufficient understanding of
Indian realities, especially the influence that movements of implementing agencies' senior staff
can have on the degree of support given to the project and on local perception of priorities.
Changes in those priorities early into TA implementation, which were among the causes of
subsequent delays, came as a surprise to ADB.

4.     Many detailed outputs of the TA stand in contrast to the project's modest outcomes and
legacy. Among the latter, the most notable are an indirect contribution to the enactment of
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification for 2006 (under component A), environment-
related geographic information system (GIS) applications under component C (in Madhya
Pradesh), greater familiarity with cleaner production concepts under component D, and several
categories of enhanced capacity (including wetlands management, and better targeting of
investments in hazardous waste management and air quality control measures) under component
E (in West Bengal). Component B, to be implemented in Gujarat, was cancelled in 2005.

5.      Some valuable subcomponents and useful outputs did not overcome the lack of
cohesion across components. The project never became, as intended, a tool for forging better
coordination and synergy between central and state environmental actions; and ended up as
five (and soon, four) components being implemented in isolation from each other. There was a
lack of common thread between the unifying wording of the TA paper with its design and
monitoring framework (DMF) and the actual outputs and outcomes of the TA.

6.      It is possible to hail design flexibility and efforts to optimize TA resources, as the
technical assistance completion report (TCR) put it, and acknowledge the relative success of
most additional activities formulated in 2003. However, these were more of a response to a
collapsing structure of the original design.

    Details of the TA projects are in Appendix 1. They are not footnoted when they are referred to in the text.
                                                                                Appendix 3      41


7.       It is possible, too, to agree with the TCR when it says that "although TA was well
conceptualized, ADB lacked adequate planning, preparedness, continuity, and allocation of
dedicated personnel necessary for implementation of such complex cluster TA. Limited
availability of dedicated personnel affected coordination with consultants, sometimes resulting in
lack of clarity on scope and deliverables." It is less easy to agree with the TCR when it says that
"...It required significant efforts later on from ADB and some IAs [implementing agencies] over
extended duration to bring activities back on track to meet overall TA objectives." For the most
part, activities by then were on different tracks and the gap between what was originally
intended and what subsequently emerged grew larger.

8.       The formal justification of the cluster approach for the project was weak. The informal
justification, anchored in a combination of the scale of environmental problems that India faced,
appears to have carried the day.

9.      Despite what is considered here to be an unsuccessful project, ADB demonstrated a
dogged determination to bring the project to an honorable end. It succeeded in that and its
credibility in India remains untarnished.

B.     Introduction

10.     Evaluation purpose and process. The outcomes and impacts of complex projects, of
which the environmental management TA is undisputedly one, require a passage of time. Unlike
several other TA projects evaluated as part of this technical assistance performance evaluation
report (TPER), the time since TA completion (June 2007) is relatively short. Nonetheless, a
sufficiently clear picture emerges even at this early stage, as this report hopes to show.

11.     The evaluation took place in the field during 21­25 June 2010, preceded by a detailed
desk review of relevant documentation. The evaluation team interviewed the current staff of the
TA executing agency (MOEF); concerned implementing agencies--state pollution control
boards (SPCBs) of Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal, and the National Productivity Council--
as well as ADB staff involved in the formulation and supervision of the TA in Manila and in the
resident mission, together with selected consultants involved in TA implementation. The
evaluation team had full access to (an incomplete) TA-related documentation, including the TCR
that rated the TA partly successful bordering on successful.

12.      Technical assistance objectives. The primary objective of the TA cluster, as described
in the TA paper, was to strengthen environmental management in the states and territories of
India by improving the operational systems and institutional frameworks for developing and
implementing suitable environmental management policies and mechanisms. This was to be
supported by a number of activities responding to mutually supportive secondary objectives,
identified as (i) providing alternative solutions and programs for industry to comply with
environmental standards through means other than "end-of-pipe" waste treatment technologies;
(ii) strengthening state-level environmental management and planning mechanisms, and local
expertise; and (iii) improving interstate information exchange and cooperation in testing new
approaches to environmental management, as well as monitoring and enforcing environmental
laws and regulations.

13.     The TA cluster consisted of five components. The objectives of each were subordinated
to the overall objectives of the cluster and were as follows:
        (i)     Component A: Promotion and assessment of environmentally sound
                projects (MOEF as implementing agency). The objectives were to (a) address
42        Appendix 3



                   the most critical methodological and technical capability gaps in planning
                   environmentally sound economic and social development; (b) build on the
                   outputs and outcomes of a recently completed ADB TA for Strengthening EIA
                   Capacity and Environmental Legislation; and (c) help MOEF become more
                   proactive in developing, for application at the state level, guidelines and
                   implementing rules for clean development policies, strategic and regional EIA to
                   conform with existing national and state environmental assessment legislation,
                   and integrated economic and environmental planning.2
          (ii)     Component B: Feasibility planning for the establishment of an environment
                   management institute (EMI) in Gujarat (Gujarat Pollution Control Board as
                   implementing agency). The objective was to formulate a feasibility-level master
                   plan for a state EMI and, depending on the outcome of the feasibility
                   assessment, follow it up with (a) organization and start-up plans for the institute;
                   (b) development of training manuals and training of personnel in the public and
                   private sector; (c) development of a marketing and business plan for the institute;
                   and (d) development of a database, information tracking, and computerized
                   environmental licensing system.
          (iii)    Component C: Adopting environmental management policies and strategies
                   at state level (Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board as implementing agency).
                   The objective was to assist the authorities of Madhya Pradesh, one of ADB "focal
                   states," in (a) the development of environment policies and strategies, including
                   introduction of market-based instruments (MBls), to supplement the command and
                   control approaches that had had limited success; and (b) improving the
                   implementation of environmental legislation, regulations, and standards in
                   accordance with central government legislation and regulations, and Madhya
                   Pradesh State Environment Policy and Broad Action Plan.
          (iv)     Component D: Financing cleaner production (MOEF as implementing
                   agency). The objectives were to (a) strengthen the financing mechanisms used in
                   the country to support adoption of cleaner production, and (b) develop a
                   comprehensive financing plan for promoting cleaner production.
          (v)      Component E: Integrated environmental management case study in
                   Kolkata (later renamed as Strengthening Environmental Management at
                   West Bengal Pollution Control Board) (West Bengal Pollution Control Board
                   as implementing agency). The objective was to take advantage of a number of
                   existing programs for improvement of environmental conditions in Kolkata to
                   conduct a pilot study on the integration of different aspects of environmental
                   management from the standpoint of the regulator, the polluter, the provider of
                   environmental services, and the public.

14.     Further, a suite of additional activities was undertaken during the project's extension
period. These included (a) GIS Mapping Training for Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board ­
follow-on activity for component C; (b) Strategic Planning for SPCBs and Development of
Environmental Visions and Environmental Monitors for Two States; (c) Feasibility Planning for
Establishment of an EMI in West Bengal; (d) Cosponsorship of International Conference on
Education for a Sustainable Future--in partnership with MOEF, the United Nations Environment
Programme, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); (e) International

    This TA was executed by MOEF and implemented between 1997 and 1999. The TA supported government's
    efforts to strengthen institutional and human resource capacity by (i) refining environmental planning, EIA
    methodologies and procedures, as well as related regulations; and (ii) training an adequate number of
    administrators and environmental specialists across the country in EIA review.

for International Development (USAID), the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership, and
the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
C.        Design and Implementation

15.     Rationale. India's environment has long been threatened by the country's rapid
economic and population growth. Environmental management in India is decentralized, and
responses to environmental threats are largely the responsibility of state and local agencies, in
particular SPCBs, and state departments of environment. At the start of the new millennium,
these state bodies were underfinanced, incompletely informed, and weak in enforcing
environmental laws and EIA requirements. Command and control, and attention to "end-of-pipe"
technical remedies, dominated the management approach. In turn, the regulated community
faced (and sought to avoid) high compliance cost associated with the regulatory approach.

16.     A better understanding of the reasons for insufficient progress emerged by then, to a
significant degree based on ADB's own experience with earlier or ongoing environment-related
loans and TA.3 Among the main causes identified were inadequate technical skills and
knowledge by the polluters of methods of minimizing waste generation and treating polluting
discharges, lack of mechanisms to fund necessary changes in polluters' operating processes,
inconsistent and often lax enforcement, limitations in state and local capacity to implement the
EIA regulations, and a technical and institutional disconnect between economic and
environmental planning.

17.     Formulation. ADB discussions with central government officials indicated a high level of
awareness of the problems described in paras. 15­16 and interest in improving regulatory
practices and applying alternative or complementary approaches such as integrated economic
and environmental development planning, MBIs, and promotion of cleaner production. The
environmental management TA recognized the limited experience of local and state bodies with
these applications, and identified a need to strengthen the organization and administration in
SPCBs, state environment departments, and MOEF. Discussions with national and state officials

  also revealed that while the challenges from state to state were similar, there was limited sharing
  of experience among state agencies and few attempts to undertake pilot programs in one state
  that could be evaluated and copied elsewhere.

  18.     The TA paper described the cluster as "conceived as part of a structured, action-learning
  process that will continue beyond TA completion" (TA paper, p. 8). To bolster this process of
  innovation and institutional change, case study material, substantive guidelines, and an action
  plan for upgrading environmental capacity in the states was to be generated and synthesized as
  a key output of the TA. A broad-based environmental management forum was to be convened
  involving SPCBs and state environment departments, other central and state government
  representatives, the private sector, civil society, and external funding agencies. The forum
  would review, validate, and agree a time-bound and monitorable plan for replication,
  consolidation, and mainstreaming of successes. TA outcomes and lessons would be built into
  training and refresher courses at the Indian Administrative Services staff college. Progress of
  implementation would be reported in India's Annual State of the Environment Report.

  19.      Four components said to correspond to four major categories of the environmental
  management system (those categories are unspecified but presumed to be clean development,
  efficient EIA process, improved enforcement, and assistance to the regulated community) and
  the fifth--consisting of a case study on integrating the outputs and recommendations of the four
  components, and demonstrating actual environmental management approaches at the state
  level--were then chosen to be the five pillars of the TA.

  20.     Cost, financing, and executing arrangements. The total cost of the TA cluster was
  estimated at $4.8 million equivalent, comprising $2.4 million in foreign exchange and
  $2.4 million in local currency. The TA was financed by ADB's TA program in the amount of
  $3.6 million to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $2.4 million and $1.2 million equivalent
  of the local currency cost. The Government of India was to finance the balance of the local
  currency cost equivalent to $1.2 million to cover salaries and wages, the cost of domestic travel
  and per diem of counterpart staff, office space, facilities, supplies, reports, and documentation in
  its possession (Table A3.1).

  21.   MOEF was designated the executing agency for the TA cluster. Each component had an
  implementing agency guided by MOEF. Component A was implemented by MOEF itself,
  component B by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), component C by the Madhya
                                                                                          Appendix 3       45


Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB), component D originally by the National Productivity
Council, and component E by West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) in cooperation
with Calcutta Municipal Corporation. MOEF was to organize and chair a TA steering committee
consisting of the MOEF secretary, the National Productivity Council secretary, and chairpersons
of GPCB, MPPCB, and WBPCB. The steering committee was to include at least two
representatives of the private sector and nongovernment organizations, be advised by the
consultants engaged under the TA, and be entitled to invite additional members from other
SPCBs, especially from states that had expressed interest in replicating TA activities through
own means.

22.     The MOEF-designated TA manager was to have supervisory authority over TA
implementation in coordination with the consulting company team leaders. Each implementing
agency was to appoint a TA component leader. The TA manager and the five TA component
leaders would form the TA technical committee. An ADB-financed TA coordinator was to serve
as the committee's secretary.

23.     Consultants and scheduling. International and domestic consultants were to be
recruited for a total of 48 and 175 person-months, respectively. The planned consultant input
under each component is given in Table A3.2. Consultant companies were recruited for each
component and an individual for the position of a TA coordinator. The composition of consultant
expertise under each component is summarized in Box A3.1.

24.    One of the international consultants under component A was to serve as the team leader,
and one of the domestic consultants under the same component as assistant team leader. Both
were expected to attend the coordination meetings during implementation of the whole cluster.
                                                                                                 Appendix 3         47


25.    The TA was to be implemented over 29 months from April 2000 to August 2002 and was
staggered as follows: (i) component A: April 2000­May 2001, (ii) component B: November
2000­March 2002; (iii) component C: November 2000­October 2001, (iv) component D: May
2001­February 2002, and (v) component E: August 2001­August 2002.

26.      All deadlines were missed, most by a substantial margin. The TA was officially closed
almost 5 years late in June 2007, and financially closed at the very end of 2008. An extensive
trail of reasons for delays and responses to them, representing substantial administrative cost,
can be found for each component. The reasons include delayed signing of the TA agreement;
staggered transfer of implementation responsibility from ADB headquarters to the resident
mission starting in March 2003, which slowed things down initially (before improving matters
later on); belated recruitment of the TA coordinator, whose main role would have been to
facilitate implementation; efforts to accommodate additional activities by cofinanciers (e.g., GTZ
under component C); financial disagreements between the principal contractor and the local
subcontractor in the case of component A, with ADB seemingly unable to influence; change of
implementing agency (component D); restructuring of component B (before final cancellation in
2005); and slippages under all components except a restructured component E, where the
slippages were few (following 3 years of initial inactivity, however).4

27.    As for consultant performance, this varied considerably. In the case of components A
and C, the consultant team produced draft final reports by the end of the original TA
implementation period (August 2002). The work was marked by internal disagreements on the
consultant side (leading to resignation of the component team leader) under component A, and
general dissatisfaction with the quality and usefulness of outputs under component C.5

28.    Further consultant input was mobilized for additional activities under component C (after
2003) and in this case, the consultant performance was considered satisfactory. No consultant
was engaged under component B. Consultant work started late under components D (2002)
and E (2004) while the scope of work was being modified. Under component D, the work was
marked by a cool and distant relationship between the implementing agency (MOEF) and the
consultant group during the initial year, when ADB tried to mediate. The original TORs for
component D were more research- than action-oriented, and this clouded the perception of the
component's usefulness and the relationship between the two parties. Consulting work under
component E was last to start but the most successful, both for the quality of consultant work
and unity of purpose between the implementing agency's objectives and the consultant TOR.

29.     Design changes. During TA implementation, additional activities were conceived and
carried out. The additional activities were as follows:
        (i)    Activity 1. Implementing agency: MPPCB. Training on GIS for better
               environmental planning and decision making at MPPCB under component C
               (cofinanced with GTZ);
        (ii)   Activity 2. Implementing agency: WBPCB. Feasibility planning for establishing
               an environmental management institute in West Bengal;
        (iii)  Activity 3. Implementing agencies: MPCB and Uttarakhand Environmental
               Protection and Pollution Control Board. Strategic planning for SPCBs and
               development of environmental visions, situation analysis, and environmental

    Mentioned also as one of the reasons for delay is implementation of a follow-on activity under TA 5974-REG

                   Cooperation Agency);
          (iv)     Activity 4. Implementing agency: MOEF. An international roundtable on "Policy
                   instruments for air quality improvement in South Asian cities" in May­April 2005
                   linked to a related study by ADB South Asia Energy Division;
          (v)      Activity 5. Implementing agency: MOEF. Implementing training program
                   "Capacity building for urban air quality management decision support systems"
                   for urban local bodies and SPCBs (cofinanced with the United States
                   Environmental Protection Agency); and
          (vi)     Activity 6. Implementing agency: MOEF. Support to an international
                   conference to mark the beginning of the United Nations "Decade of Education for
                   Sustainable Development" (cofinanced with the United Nations Educational,
                   Scientific, and Cultural Organization).

30.       Several changes of scope were made at early or advanced stages of TA implementation:
          (i)  The scope of component B was revised from Feasibility Planning for the
                 Establishment of an EMI to developing operational strategy for the EMI, air
                 quality improvement action plan for Ahmedabad, and e-governance before the
                 component was dropped from the TA cluster altogether in 2005.
          (ii)   Component E, initially titled "Integrated Environmental Management Case Study
                 in Calcutta" implemented by WBPCB, was renamed "Strengthening
                 Environmental Management Planning in West Bengal" based on revised priorities
                 of the State. The scope was changed to a combination of e-governance for
                 WBPCB, development of hazardous waste management policy, a study of
                 industrial and vehicular air pollution as an input into Kolkata Air Pollution
                 Management Plan, and a study of wetlands management.

31.      Outputs. The broad objectives and logic of the project were described in paras.14­15 and
in the DMF. The way the project's desired outcomes were translated into planned outputs and
activities of individual components lacked clarity. The TA paper gives only a broad scope of each
of the five components. The DMF does not describe the TA outputs component by component but
across the board, prejudging the question of the TA cluster's coherence.6 The way different
components contributed to the TA cluster's output (and, ultimately, its outcomes) has to be pieced
together from the consultant TORs for each component (as well as the inception report of May
2001). This is done below to make it possible to judge performance component by component. In
each case, planned outputs (and corresponding activities) are compared with the outputs actually
produced (or, in relevant cases, activities actually undertaken).

          1.       Component A: Promotion and Assessment of Environmentally Sound
                   Projects

32.      Planned. The scope was to (i) identify and review laws and policies that may unwittingly
promote polluting industries; (ii) identify the role of MOEF in revising those laws and policies;
(iii) improve the processing and monitoring of EIA and issuance of no-objection certificates; and
(iv) train staff of MOEF, state environment departments, Central Pollution Control Board
(CPCB), and SPCBs to evaluate EIA and environmental planning and management reports.


6
    Only if each component were tightly subordinated to the cluster's overall objective (which turned out not to be the
    case, as being argued) might it be appropriate to evaluate the outcomes across the board, regardless of the
    performance of each component.
                                                                              Appendix 3      49


33.     The expected outputs included (i) a framework and an MOEF action plan for promotion of
pollution prevention, cleaner production and cleaner technology, and proactive environmental
management systems (EMS) in Indian industry (efforts understood to lead to "environmentally
sound projects" [ESPs]); (ii) improved EIA procedures to include a wider range of projects,
improved quality of EIA practice, and a review of key ecological and human-health issues related
to economic development; (iii) an information management plan; (iv) contribution to MOEF's
guidelines and regulations for the implementation of strategic and regional environmental
assessment; (v) a discussion paper on transboundary impacts of projects; and (vi) a series of
capacity building and training sessions (particularly at MOEF and the National Highways Authority
of India), as well as workshops to promote economic and social acceptance of the phasing out of
polluting and inefficient processes, and promote public awareness of cleaner production in India.

34.   Actual. Under promotion and assessment of ESPs, component A's final report
(volume I, section II) contains:
      (i)      "Blueprint for Action for the Promotion and Assessment of ESPs in India"
               consisting of a framework for a state-level action plan for promotion and
               assessment of ESPs as well as an action plan for MOEF.
      (ii)     A framework for a case study in Gujarat of user fees on water to promote cleaner
               production.
      (iii)    Assessments of ESPs ­ suggestions on specific initiatives for improvement in
               EIA to enhance the environmental soundness of new projects.
      (iv)  Outline for training on cleaner production financing intended to help commercial
               banks identify suitable cleaner production projects.
      (v)  Action program for a national user fee program ­ a framework and integrated
               system and mechanisms of a national pollution charge program that combines a
               command-and-control system with elements of a market-oriented system.
      (vi)  Principles and elements of a user fee program.

35.    Volume II of the final report contains background analytical and discussion material:
       (i)   Working paper "The Impacts of the Current Regulatory Regime on Cleaner
             Production and Cleaner Technology Promotion in India;"
       (ii)  Analysis of National and State Level Cleaner Production;
       (iii) Working paper "Decision Guidelines for MBI Use in India: The Case of Gujarat;"
       (iv)  Working paper "Benefits of Using MBIs for Environmental Management: An
             Application Using State-Level Data from India;"
       (v)  Outreach and Information Dissemination Needs and Strategies to Promote
             ESPs; and
       (vi)  Document "Promoting Strategic Environmental Assessment in India."

36.    Under improvement of EIA procedures, the following were produced:
       (i)    Train the Trainer Manual on EIA;
       (ii)  Papers "Linkages between the MOEF and the State" and "State and Central
              Governmental Linkages on Environmental Management;"
       (iii)  Paper "Environmental Information/Data Procedure" that reviews and evaluates
              existing Environmental Information Management Systems in MOEF;
       (iv)  Paper "Outreach and Information Dissemination Needs and Strategies to
              Promote ESPs;" and
       (v)    Paper "Promoting Strategic Environmental Assessment in India."
50     Appendix 3



37.    Under capacity building and training, four training events were organized covering the
topics of EIA preparation and review, environmental information management systems,
promoting cleaner production and cleaner technology and MBI, and promoting ESPs.

       2.      Component B: Feasibility Planning for the Establishment of GEMI

38.     Planned. The scope was to review the existing status of Gujarat Environmental
Management Institute (GEMI) and suggest modifications to improve the organizational structure,
ensure private sector involvement, and sustained financial viability. The outputs were to include
an organizational and staffing plan for GEMI; implementation of GEMI activities; a market study
for GEMI services; a 3-year business plan for GEMI; identification of organizations and firms
within India and abroad that GEMI could tap for short-term expertise to support its programs; a
database of experts within India and abroad that GEMI can work with and development of a web
page for GEMI; and on-the-job training in (i) cleaner production; (ii) research, design,
construction, and operation of air and water pollution control facilities; (iii) safety and response
systems in industries; (iv) pollution audit; (v) industrial siting; (vi) environmental aspects of
industrial estate management; and (vii) toxic and hazardous waste management.

39.    Actual. A long period of inactivity was followed by a resumption of dialogue with GPCB
in 2003. By that time, GEMI was semi-operational and, hence, the study of its feasibility had
been overtaken by events. The component was first modified in consultation with GPCB to
develop an operational strategy for GEMI, formulate an air quality improvement action plan for
Ahmedabad, and support e-governance. Even the revised plan could not be followed due to
non-resolution of key organizational and legal issues concerning GEMI. Component B was
dropped from the TA in 2005.

       3.      Component C: Adopting Environmental                 Management       Policies   and
               Strategies at State Level (Madhya Pradesh)

40.     Planned. The scope of the component was to (i) review existing environmental
standards, regulations, and legislation in Madhya Pradesh; (ii) assist state environment
department and SPCB in revising and updating existing environmental standards, rules, and
regulations; (iii) review the existing regulations and policies that unintentionally promote
polluting industries, taking into account the approaches and results of component A;
(iv) propose and pilot-test MBls or innovative approaches to financing and promoting
environmental improvements; (v) develop an environmental licensing database and information
tracking system; (vi) develop a program of upgrading the human, financial, and technical
capacity for environmental management in Madhya Pradesh; (vii) implement projects that
demonstrate the proposed policies and strategies; (viii) improve the dialogue about
environmental policy implementation involving MPPCB, state environment department, CPCB,
MOEF, state line ministries (e.g., industry, finance, public health), and the industry and
municipal governments; (ix) prepare a case study of specific opportunities for pollution
prevention planning in the industrial estate of Pithampur; (x) conduct three training and
awareness-raising workshops; and (xi) develop a Madhya Pradesh state environment policy and
broad action plan, addressing also the implementation of central government's legislation,
regulations, and standards in the state.

41.   Actual. Under the review of environmental standards and regulation in Madhya
Pradesh, these were the outputs:
      (i)     Working paper "Legal, Institutional, and Organizational Analysis of the Madhya
              Pradesh Pollution Control Board;"
                                                                                Appendix 3      51


       (ii)    Working paper "Cross-Sectoral Analysis of Madhya Pradesh Policies Regarding
               Environmentally Sound Management;"
       (iii)   Environmental Action Program in Madhya Pradesh; and
       (iv)    Working paper "Policy Instruments for Pollution Abatement in Madhya Pradesh:
               An Economic Approach."

42.    Under improved dialogue about environmental policy implementation, a document was
prepared, "Equipping the Enforcers in the Environmental Judicial Process and Exploring the
Potential for Better Environmental Management," based on a workshop organized in Bhopal on
29­30 January 2002.

43.     Under a study of specific opportunities for pollution prevention planning in the Pithampur
industrial estate, a case study was developed that proposed a framework designed to persuade
the estate's stakeholders to adopt a pollution prevention plan. An additional case study
"Incorporating Market-Based Instruments into Waste Management in Indore" was developed
exploring the use of simple MBIs to improve management of solid waste in that city.

44.     Multi-stakeholder awareness-raising workshops and training sessions were conducted
on 29­30 January 2002 and 14­15 November 2002 in Bhopal, and on 22­23 April 2002 in
Indore. Training modules developed had replication potential in other states. There was active
exchange of information among participants. Needs and issues of MPPCB officials responsible
for enforcement were discussed. Feedback and inputs contributed to further development and
future directions of the work of component C.

45.      Additional activities initiated in 2003 centered on GIS applications. Based on this, an
environmental (zoning) atlas is currently (2010) under printing. Training in GIS application was
organized for members of SPCB and other state boards. Management of environmental data was
improved, with online availability of EIA-related information (see www.mppcb.ic.in), leading to a
significant acceleration of environmental compliance procedures.

       4.      Component D: Financing Cleaner Production

46.     Planned. The component's scope was to review national and state environmental and
industrial policies and institutions that affect the adoption of cleaner production in small and
medium-sized enterprises; evaluate different financing schemes in India for the use of cleaner
production in SMEs; develop procedures for determining and monitoring the social impact, cost
savings, improvement in product quality, and environmental impact of cleaner production
projects implemented; and develop strategies and policies to promote cleaner production and
other alternatives to end-of-pipe approaches to environmental compliance. More specific
outputs included (i) a review of the functions, duties, responsibilities, organizational structure,
and staffing of existing institutions, including financing institutions that may have a role in
cleaner production promotion and recommendations on institutional modification that would
enhance that role; (ii) procedures for reviewing loan applications for introduction of cleaner
production technologies; and (iii) procedures for information dissemination to potential users of
cleaner production, screening of appropriate technology, and monitoring project execution.

47.     Actual. Under assessment of effectiveness of institutions involved in cleaner production,
the final report provides such an assessment and uses it to formulate an integrated cleaner
production and cleaner technology model. A working paper, "Cleaner Production: Issues,
Challenges, and Opportunities for India," was prepared, and the application of the model was
demonstrated through the case study of Raval Paper Mill. Another section of the final report is
52     Appendix 3



an overview of Indian SMEs in sectors such as chemicals, glass, foundry, textile, electroplating,
and chloralkali considered to have a good potential for cleaner production.

48.    Under methodology and procedures for evaluating potential borrowers for cleaner
production and cleaner technology, the following were produced:
       (i)    Models for SMEs financing and cleaner production proposals.
       (ii)  Several case studies were developed to deepen the understanding of the
              financial models' use. These include a case study of Indian Paper Mill
              (internal/self-financing of a cleaner production project), case study of
              Ankhaleshwar lndustrial Estate (financing under the cluster approach), case
              study of Hand Block Printers of Jaipur (financing horizontal networks among
              SMEs), and sector study: Chloralkali Industry (financial analysis for selecting
              cleaner technology).
       (iii)  Self-assessment toolkits were prepared to facilitate the search for finance by
              potential cleaner production borrowers.

49.     To support other forms of promoting cleaner production, a case study of networking
(Introduction of Information Technology in Knitwear Industry in Ludhiana) was developed based
on the experience of a United Nations Industrial Development Organization-supported
information technology initiative targeting SMEs in Ludhiana. A case study of Agra Cast Iron
Industry was developed to illustrate the potential of cleaner production promotion through
demonstration projects. Environmental benchmarking in the paint and coating industry with a
sample template for benchmarking was also produced.

50.    A stepwise approach toward adoption of integrated cleaner production development and
an action plan were formulated and disaggregated for national, state, and local use. This was
supplemented by an analysis of options and opportunities to promote investment in cleaner
production and cleaner technology through improved financing that targets SMEs.

51.    Workshops on financing cleaner production were organized in Chandigarh on 4 August
2003, Ahmedabad on 6 August 2003, Bangalore on 11 August 2003, and Delhi on 22 August
2003, targeting officials from financial services sector, state agencies such as SPCBs, industrial
development corporations, industrial estate associations, and cleaner production centers; and
technical staff and operators working in SMEs in the states of Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka,
Punjab, and West Bengal.

       5.      Component E: Strengthening Environmental Management at West Bengal
               Pollution Control Board (initially as Integrated Environmental Management
               Case Study in Calcutta)

52.     Planned. The initial scope was to (i) review data, findings, and recommendations of the
ongoing TA for Preparing the Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project (footnote 3); (ii) review
data related to the collection and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes; (iii) develop a
demonstration project, possibly by reference to the disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes, and
organize public consultation meetings to discuss the recommendations; (iv) review the results of
the air quality monitoring program in Calcutta financed by the Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund of Japan and, based on the review, assist WBPCB in preparing a concept paper to address
vehicular air pollution; (v) review the implementation and enforcement of water, noise, and air
pollution rules and regulations in Calcutta and West Bengal; and (vi) develop an information
tracking system and train the staff and employees of WBPCB in its use.
                                                                                 Appendix 3      53


53.     The scope of the component was changed in 2003 in favor of (i) implementation of a
web-enabled environmental management information system (EMIS); (ii) an update of the
existing inventory under the Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Amendment Rules
of 2003, and development of a hazardous waste management policy; (iii) a study of industrial
and vehicular air pollution to serve as inputs to the preparation of Calcutta Air Quality
Management Action Plan; and (iv) a study of wetlands management in West Bengal.

54.    Actual. The following outputs were realized: (i) a report "EMIS (E-Governance) at West
Bengal Pollution Control Board" was produced, (ii) an EMIS was designed and populated from
WBPCB paper files, and (iii) a pilot study was undertaken to test the system. A workshop was
organized to discuss the pilot study. The agency then engaged trained data-entry operators to
continue populating the database under the guidance of an EMIS expert. The work was
completed in November 2006 and the system handed over to WBPCB.

55.     Under hazardous waste management, a report "Hazardous Waste Management
(Inventory and Action Plan for the State)" was produced that addresses most aspects of
hazardous waste management--i.e., the legislative context, industrial and waste-generation
situation and trends in West Bengal, a strategy for hazardous waste management--and makes
recommendations.

56.     Under industrial and vehicular air pollution, a report "Ambient Air Quality Improvement
Action Plan for Kolkata City" was prepared. This contains an air pollution model ("Kolkata Air
Pollution Potential Emissions Reductions Model") and recommended emission control strategies.

57.     The report on "Wetlands Management in West Bengal," prepared under the component,
developed a plan for East Kolkata wetlands. It contains, among others, maps of water bodies'
status based on high-resolution satellite data, database of important water bodies and wetlands
using satellite imagery through GIS and remote sensing techniques, inventory of water bodies
and a corresponding management plan supported by a cost-benefit analysis, policy statement
and recommendations for appropriate legislation, and action plan for the East Kolkata wetlands.

       6.      Additional Activities

58.     The additional activities had an array of outputs designed specifically in consultation with
the implementing agencies. This included GIS training modules for MPPCB officials (activity 1),
a feasibility report for establishing an environmental management institute in West Bengal for
WBPCB (activity 2), strategic action plans and GIS monitors and training for MPCB and the
Uttarakhand Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Board (activity 3), an international
roundtable on policy instruments for air quality improvement in south Asian cities (activity 4), a
training program on urban air quality management decision-support systems for urban local
bodies and SPCBs (activity 5), and support to a United Nations conference on education for
sustainable development (activity 6). All the outputs were produced on time and their quality
was accepted by the respective implementing agencies.

59.     Policy framework. The Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 made MOEF the top
policy-making body in the field of environment protection. The MOEF acts through the CPCB
and the SPCBs, although it does not have a direct supervising mandate on the SPCBs, and the
line between central and state authorities is still blurred. The CPCB is a statutory organization
and the nodal agency for pollution control. While its basic functions are still prevention, control,
and abatement of air and water pollution, the various SPCBs assume these functions at state
level. The CPCB's role has traditionally been advisory in nature, restricted to prescribing the
54        Appendix 3



standard limits for various pollutants and providing technical or scientific assistance. The SPCBs
may adopt stricter limits if they choose. The SPCBs have overwhelmingly employed three
instruments--consent to establish producing units, consent to operate, and prescribe standards
for air and water pollution. The other functions of the SPCBs are advising the state
governments, formulation of preventive methods, technology development, industrial zoning,
disposal of hazardous wastes, and collection and dissemination of information on the prevention
and control of pollution. Several analyses exist that summarize the challenges to India's
environmental protection system as they were at the time of TA formulation.7 Briefly, the
principal ones were (i) procedural and command and control-based, rather than economics- and
policy-based, approach to pollution control; (ii) insufficient capacity of SPCBs to go beyond
command and control (and offer, for instance, technical support); (iii) weak infrastructure of
regulatory agencies; and (iv) poor enforcement and monitoring capacity.

60.     More recent assessments (e.g., the World Bank's country environment analysis of 2005
completed halfway through the TA's implementation) help place the TA's objectives and
achievements in a broader context. They identify a rising public demand for better
environmental quality, often driven by an influential urban middle class and backed up by the
judiciary, increasingly accompanied by voluntary environmental performance obligations from
India's large-scale corporate sector and industry, but which are yet to be matched by the
regulatory capacity of environmental agencies. The same analysis is somewhat skeptical about
the extent to which judiciary can fill the vacuum left by the lack of regulatory oversight, and quick
to remind everyone that alongside the large-scale corporate sector, there is an extensive SME
and informal sector with a troubling environmental record. A review of the EIA process was
commissioned by MOEF in 2005 and a new National Environmental Policy released in 2006.
The former, culminating in a joint Government of India and World Bank study, pointed to
(i) breakdown in public trust and constructive dialogue in addressing environmental
management issues; (ii) absence of a commonly shared vision on the way forward that would
involve all principal stakeholders and reconciling diverse perspectives; (iii) a need for a long-
term national program of supporting public participation in environmental management and
building civil society's capacity to understand the environmental issues; (iv) a good scope for
project developers and regulators alike to take advantage of the passage of the Right of
Information Act to improve public relations; (v) the need to match growing public demand for
better performance by the environmental regulatory agencies with adequate support to these
agencies, conditional on institutional reforms to increase efficiency, transparency, and
accountability; (vi) need to considerably expand and strengthen the toolkit used by regulators to
ease compliance by a very diverse regulated community, in particular activities other than those
of large point sources that cause significant cumulative environmental impacts; (vii) good case
for supporting clusters of SMEs that combine focused enforcement effort with extensive
outreach and compliance assistance; (viii) a good case for designing more effective, area-based
pollution management programs; (ix) the desirability to evaluate, refine, and expand the recently
introduced bank guarantee (performance bond) system in selected states as a condition of
renewing an environmental license; (x) desirability better to recognize and encourage good
environmental performance and voluntary initiatives by industry; and (xi) need to improve the
public disclosure practices. In addition to the critical roles of the environmental regulator and the
civil society, there is also a fundamental need for sector agencies to facilitate better
environmental compliance and performance of individual projects; more sustainable
development of the sector as a whole; and greater cross-sector coordination, particularly at the

planning stage. Environmental monitoring and enforcement of specific sources can do very little
to improve the situation on the ground if environmental factors were not considered at the time
of location decisions, project design, and technology choices. Sector agencies and local
governments are typically better positioned to influence these choices than the environmental
regulator.

61.     The ADB strategy in the environment sector in India shows awareness of some of these
considerations even if it does not deal with the specifics of the problem(s). The most relevant
documents of the time8 place emphasis on (i) improving the urban environment by developing
urban environmental infrastructure for pollution prevention and waste management;
(ii) developing renewable and efficient energy; and--of particular relevance here--(iii) building
capacity for environmental management and planning, policy formulation, environmental
assessment, regulation enforcement, and pollution monitoring. ADB's loan and TA of direct
relevance to environmental management was briefly described (para. 14). The environmental
management TA was included in the TA pipeline for India 1999­2001.

D.         erformance Assessment
          P

62.      Overall assessment. The TA was a bold response to a plausibly and eloquently identified
set of problems of environmental management in India. Unfortunately, the boldness was not
matched by adequate understanding of Indian realities by ADB and its ability to steer
implementation during the planned implementation period (2000­2002). Disappointing results during
that period finally propelled ADB into action and, starting in 2003 with implementation transferred
from ADB headquarters to the resident mission, the project underwent extensive redesign.
Additional activities were formulated, and other modifications were undertaken to make up for
cancellation of a major component and a misdiagnosed view of state environmental priorities of the
original TA document. Some interesting and positive results were obtained then, in most cases, but
accruing between 3 and 5 years later than originally expected. With only a few exceptions, the TA's
long list of outputs stands in contrast to the impact, which is modest for the most part.

63.     In retrospect, the cluster approach overstated the degree of synergy among the project's
five components and, in the end, existed on paper only. That being the case, the evaluation
needs to consider performance component by component. That performance, and performance
overall, is summarized in Table A3.3, the justification provided further below.

64.    Overall, the TA is rated partly relevant, less effective, inefficient, and less likely to be
sustainable; and is considered unsuccessful.

65.    Relevance. The TA's relevance is in large part a measure of the government's
commitment to the TA's objectives, and a fit with the ADB country strategy (country assistance
plan 1999­2001). The TA paper speaks of a commitment by the central and state governments to
the project's objectives as formulated, however changes in concerned TA officials in executing
agency and implementing agencies affected that. Local officials supporting the original TA design
were soon gone. In components B, D, and E, this resulted in lack of progress and subsequent
need to alter the project scope.9

66.      The choice of a cluster approach to TA design would have deserved more careful scrutiny
than it received. Mainly arguing, as the TA paper did, that states shared similar challenges and
stating the objective of greater sharing of lessons across state administrative boundaries was an
insufficient justification for a cluster approach.10 It is no exaggeration to say that for all practical
purposes the TA was implemented as four separate components (one component being
cancelled). The links between components were scarce and the administrative mechanisms that
were to generate the cross-component synergies were either not created or not well used.

67.     As to relevance of individual components, the picture that emerges 3 years after the
TA's official completion is this:
        (i)     Component A was originally designed to assist with strengthening of the EIA
                process, environmentally sound development, and related legislative tools, but
                appears to have been sidelined by other ongoing initiatives that had similar goals
                as component A and were already firmly anchored in the MOEF establishment
                (the World Bank had a long history of projects with MOEF, e.g., the Sardar
                Sarovar in 1980s, the Environment Action Plan in 1993, and the Environment
                Management Capacity Building Project [EMCBP] in 1997­2004). Among these,




9
   The same personnel changes can, in principle, work in the project's favor. This occurred under component E where
   a new configuration of key individuals in 2003 gave a major boost to implementation. In the world of largely
   unpredictable (to an outsider) personnel changes, however, it is more likely that strong commitment will be
   replaced by a weak one, rather than followed by another strong commitment.

   A review of other ADB TA projects that adopted a cluster approach at the time (ADB. 1998. Proposed Technical
   Assistance Cluster to the People's Republic of China for the Promotion of Clean Technology. Manila [TA 3079-
   PRC, for $3.5 million, approved on 29 September]); ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of
   China for Transjurisdiction Environmental Management. Manila (TA 3588-PRC, for $2.1 million, approved on
   11 December); or, going beyond environment-related TAs, ADB. 2001. Proposed Technical Assistance Cluster to
   the Kingdom of Cambodia for Strengthening Public Financial Management. Manila (TA 3634-CAM, for $1.2 million,
   approved on 22 February) or ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance Cluster to the Republic of Tajikistan for Improving
   Aid Coordination and External Debt Management. Manila (TA 3617-TAJ, for $1 million, approved on 21 December)
   suggests that the key stated reasons for adopting the approach were a mixture of the trivial ("need to focus on
   issues in a comprehensive manner, need to ensure active participation of concerned government agencies in the
   design and preparation of subprojects, holistic approach to address environmental problems") and the more
   meaningful (involvement of several national-level agencies, need to integrate economic policymaking, legislation
   and technical support, sequencing, and coordination of specialized inputs). Some in the latter group did apply to
   TA 3423 without, however, providing sufficient justification for clustering. That justification may well be found
   among unstated reasons that emerge upon closer inquiry. These are dominated by the search for administrative
   efficiency, a sort of "TA economies of scale," as well as the corporate need to relate the volume of TA to the size of
   the loan portfolio (large, in the case of India).
                                                                                            Appendix 3        57


                 the World Bank TA11 project to MOEF and the Prime Minister's Office-sponsored
                 internal reviews12 of investment norms and related regulatory processes. While
                 some of these studies were recognized in the TA paper at the time of TA
                 formulation, these studies, to a great degree, overtook and superseded the
                 environmental TA's agenda, signifying the weakness in TA design. To put it
                 simply, component A went ahead, but nobody paid much attention to it. The
                 component is rated partly relevant.
        (ii)     Component B was cancelled after several rounds of deliberations between the
                 Gujarat State Pollution Control Board and ADB to develop a new scope of work
                 once the original intent of undertaking a feasibility study for the proposed EMI
                 had became redundant because the state government had already established
                 an EMI before the TA was mobilized. Subsequent efforts to resurrect the
                 component by adding new activities to support the incipient EMI fell through due
                 to delays in appointment of counterpart staff. Not rated.
        (iii)    Component C's design was pertinent to MPPCB's short- to medium-term
                 objectives. However, lackluster performance by the TA consultant (including in
                 the collaboration with MPPCB, the implementing agency) affected ownership
                 from the MPPCB and its buy-in of final outputs. This situation was ameliorated to
                 some degree by the introduction of an additional activity on use of GIS for
                 improved environmental planning and decision making at MPPCB. On balance,
                 the component is rated relevant.
        (iv)     Component D, while recognizing the key concept of financing cleaner production
                 in its design, failed to identify suitable financial institutions that could add value to
                 the scope by advising stakeholders on practical challenges of financing cleaner
                 production. Their absence robbed the TA of any institution with actual working
                 knowledge of cleaner production financing. The TA scope had to be amended to
                 make sense to the beneficiaries. It was more research-oriented and lacked a
                 practical approach to cleaner production financing, and was not tailored to the
                 needs of the industry during 2000­2004. Several training programs were
                 belatedly developed to ensure a basic level of understanding of cleaner
                 production to make it possible for the stakeholders to understand and then apply
                 financial management principles developed under a pilot demonstration project.
                 Rated partly relevant.
        (v)      Component E's original design was questioned by the implementing agency,
                 WBPCB, and the component did not proceed until agreement on scope had been
                 reached. Instead of the original intention (as stipulated in the TA paper) to build
                 on the outputs of the TA on Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, other
                 and wider aspects of environmental management were included, such as
                 wetlands management, hazardous waste, and air quality issues relevant to the
                 city of Kolkata. The component benefited from effective leadership at the
                 implementing agency, who took keen interest in the development of TA products.
                 However, the inadequacy of the original design and ensuing changes warrant a
                 partly relevant rating.

   Environment Management Capacity Building Project, World Bank 1997­2004. The goal of that project was
   remarkably similar to that of the environmental management TA, i.e., assist the government in implementing its
   environmental priorities as outlined in the Environmental Action Program. The project's six components were
   (i) environmental policy planning; (ii) environmental administration; (iii) decentralization of environmental
   management; (iv) environmental law implementation; (v) monitoring and compliance in high-priority environmental
   problem areas; and (vi) strengthening of Gujarat's Department of Forests and Environment and the Ecology
   Commission, as well as preparation of a State Environmental Action Program.

       (vi)   Additional activities score a partly relevant rating. While all were designed in
              close coordination with the implementing agency's counterpart staff, not all
              activities could be said to be contributing directly to the original goal of the TA.
              Activity 4 (international roundtable on "Policy Instruments for Air Quality
              Improvement in South Asian Cities"), for instance, provided input for the ADB
              publication "Policy Instruments for Air Quality Improvement in South Asian Cities"
              and did not have any direct relevance to the goal of the TA as outlined in the TA
              paper. Additional activities were conceived as much to derive value for the
              overall TA investment (i.e., to use leftover funds sensibly) as to salvage the
              reputation of the TA and could be argued to be a series of afterthoughts.

68.     Effectiveness. A large TA is bound to produce a large number of outputs and, not
surprisingly, this was also the case of the environmental management TA (paras. 32­59).

69.    The discussion below evaluates each component for effectiveness.
       (i)    Component A. Outputs were overshadowed by the MOEF-sponsored
              reengineering of its environmental clearance process in early 2000, where the
              Environment Resources and Management consulting group released a report on
              environmental clearances in 2003, and the National Environment Engineering
              Institute (NEERI) in Nagpur produced a national guidance manual on EIA
              practice, including support manuals on selected development projects, in 2003.
              These outputs limited the applicability of component A's outputs. During project
              implementation, training for National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) staff
              strengthened environmental management capacity of NHAI with the intent of
              developing its own environmental management system in later years. Little
              evidence of any of the component outcomes could be found during the mission.
              Its outputs do not seem to be, or have been, sufficiently used or even mentioned
              in any reports or products subsequently produced by the MOEF, unlike those of
              the World Bank and other national initiatives. The component was less effective.
       (ii)   Component B. No outputs produced as component was cancelled. Hence, no
              outcomes.
       (iii)  Component C. Outputs were questioned by MOEF and MPPCB for any value
              addition, and there were considerable delays in approval of the draft final report.
              This can also partly be attributed to the fact that MPPCB officials changed
              between the fact-finding stage, inception (scope setting), and draft final report,
              thereby questioning the original set of outputs. The GIS training provided to
              MPCCB staff and relevant stakeholders as part of the additional activity proved to
              be a huge success and enabled effective use of the GIS system installed as part
              of the component. On balance and when taking into account its overall
              objectives, the component is rated less effective.
       (iv)   Component D. From its initial design, this component did not have any
              demonstrable outcome all the way to the draft final report, the review of which led
              to the conduct of a pilot for financing cleaner production interventions in SMEs
              through the commercial banking sector and by using a self-assessment toolkit.
              Addition of training programs and pilot demonstration activities toward the end
              helped the component reach a logical conclusion to all research, analysis and
              strategy inputs, policies, and financial procedures undertaken previously. Since
              there was no direct involvement by or patronage from any financial institution
              (such as the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India or the Small
              Industrial Development Bank of India) with a mandate on cleaner production
              financing, there was no transfer of know-how or procedures, and hence no
                                                                                Appendix 3      59


              avenue for longevity of the outcomes. Financing of cleaner production remains a
              challenge in India, and the TA was not able to make any perceptible contribution
              to improvement in the area. The component is considered less effective.
       (v)    Component E. After a start-up delay to accommodate design modifications, the
              component did not look back. It benefited from effective leadership at the
              implementing agency (WBPCB and Institute of Environmental Studies and
              Wetland Management) who took keen interest in the development of TA products.
              The TA has been instrumental in the adoption of a government order for control of
              pollution from the construction industry. To this day, its work on wetlands inventory
              and management is acknowledged as particularly valuable by the Government of
              West Bengal stakeholders. West Bengal has initiated follow-up actions on
              management of wetlands mapping including offering TA to other states, including a
              Ramsar site; and developing a facility for management of toxic and hazardous
              wastes. After reformulation and with wholehearted participation of WBPCB and
              good support from the consultants, the results turned positive and are still used
              effectively, justifying an effective rating.
       (vi)   Additional activities. These were assessed to be partly effective in some cases
              while not in others. The GIS training (activity 1) was effective in developing the
              skills of MPPCB staff such that environmental zoning is being used at MPPCB
              and a zoning atlas is now formally being printed. MPPCB also offered GIS
              training to other SPCBs. However, owing to lack of financial resources, the EMI
              (activity 2) has not been established in West Bengal despite ADB's and
              WBPCB's best efforts. Hence, while the feasibility report was prepared and
              accepted by WBPCB, it did not provide suitable financial instruments for
              establishment of the EMI, leaving it to the mercy of external funding. Similarly,
              environmental vision, situation analysis, and environmental monitors (activity 3)
              for Maharashtra and Uttarakhand did not lead to any investments although a
              concept paper for setting up an Environmental Infrastructure Development
              Corporation was produced by MPCB. Activity 4 (international roundtable on
              "policy instruments for air quality improvement in South Asian cities") and activity
              6 (support to international conference for United Nations decade of education for
              sustainable development) were isolated events, well delivered on their own merit,
              but no outcome contribution to the original goal of the TA. On balance, rated less
              effective.

70.     Efficiency. Given that the second-largest component (component B), which accounted
for almost one-fourth of the TA's projected cost, was ultimately cancelled after substantial cost
to ADB and a time overrun of 5 years, the project can only be described as inefficient. The
responsibility for that has to be borne largely by ADB and, to a degree, by some of the
consultant groups. Through insufficient and distant supervision, ADB allowed problems to
accumulate during the initial 2 years, only to be confronted by a near-collapse of the entire
project late in 2002. Table A3.3 below provides the delays the TA incurred across various
milestones during its implementation.

71.        Each of the components is evaluated for efficiency below.
           (i)    Component A. Overall implementation was delayed on account of poor
                  management control exercised by the consulting firm. The component suffered
                  delivery issues, and the team leader was replaced by the consulting firm in the
                  middle of TA implementation with no reference to ADB or MOEF. ADB had to
                  work very hard with the consulting firm in question to get the desired outputs.
                  Component A was the largest component in the cluster with an ADB financing of
                  $770,000. However, its intended outcome of promoting cooperation and
                  information exchange between states, including on cleaner production, better EIA
                  processes, and strengthened environment management capacity at NHAI,13
                  seemed to have not met their objective. This, coupled with consultant delivery
                  and team management issues, initial implementation struggle encountered by
                  ADB, potential outcomes overshadowed by the World Bank-funded EMCBP and
                  the Government of India's initiatives, and delays in completion, and when
                  assessed in light of the investment made warrants an inefficient rating.
           (ii)   Component B. The feasibility study of establishing an EMI was eventually
                  dropped after several months of discussions and negotiations with the
                  implementing agency. GPCB was already in the process of establishing the
                  institute when the component was designed. In discussions with GPCB, the
                  component was redesigned. Despite this, delays in appointing the TA counterpart
                  staff resulted in loss of whatever little traction there was, and the component was
                  finally dropped.
           (iii)  Component C. Here, too, the consultants presented ADB and MPPCB with
                  quality issues. The draft report prepared by the consultant required better
                  structuring and stronger analysis, and was only accepted after necessary
                  revisions and a resultant delay. ADB had consultant issues over the TA
                  administration as well. The component only got real traction with MPPCB after a
                  redesign and inclusion of GIS training for MPPCB staff who used the GIS
                  equipment provided to MPPCB. Despite a tumultuous implementation period,
                  including difficulties with the consultant and the outputs, the component was able
                  to salvage some of its pride by undertaking the GIS training and engaging with
13
     ADB. 2007. Sector Assistance Program Evaluation: Transport Sector in India ­ Focusing on Results. Manila
     identified the need to strengthen capability of highway authorities to address environmental and social issues,
     including resettlement and HIV/AIDS. As late as April 2010, the Minister of State in the Ministry of Road Transport
     and Highways acknowledged in Indian parliament that highway projects had been delayed mainly because of
     problems associated with land acquisition, obtaining environment and forest clearance, and poor performance of
     some contractors due to cash-flow constraints (Source: Press Trust of India/New Delhi, 27 April 2010).
                                                                                    Appendix 3       61


               the beneficiaries of the TA, thus attesting to optimal use of TA resources, albeit in
               the TA extension period. On balance, rated less efficient.
       (iv)    Component D. This had a change in implementing agency from the National
               Productivity Council, which was noted to have a conflict of interest due to its
               consulting mandate, a fact that was not understood by ADB during fact-finding.
               MOEF was assigned the role of implementing agency. However, absence of any
               direct involvement by a financial institution in TA delivery meant that there was
               no avenue to transfer the knowledge gained in an efficient manner. The
               consultants felt underutilized without a pilot model to demonstrate the principles
               of cleaner production financing to the stakeholders and struggled to engage with
               their audience in the absence of a financial institution that would facilitate such
               engagement. Change of implementing agency, need for involving a financial
               institution, and extending the component to pilot the cleaner production model led
               to a delay in completion of the component. Rated inefficient.
       (v)     Component E. Although the component did not start until 2003, 3 years after the
               original start date, once ADB and WBPCB agreed on scope, it proceeded along
               smoothly and without major interruptions. WBPCB was supportive of the
               component and its proposed products, and the consultants performed admirably.
               After the start-up delay, TA resources were used efficiently, although there was a
               minor hiccup in the middle due to change in the executing management at the
               WBPCB. Taking into consideration the initial delay of 3 years, the component is
               rated less efficient.
       (vi)    Additional activities. If assessed in isolation, the activities were efficiently
               executed. However, they need to be considered in the context of the original TA
               design and resource allocation. Optimal utilization of TA savings to generate
               these activities needs to be lauded although, as designed, they appeared to be
               more "extras" than additional activities and did not quite fit the overall direction of
               the TA cluster--with the exception of activity 1 (GIS training of MPPCB) and
               activity 2 (establishment of EMI in West Bengal).

72.     Sustainability. At a cluster level, there is little to suggest that the direction of the project
is sustainable. Because it underutilized (or downright omitted) parts of the coordination structure
(mainly the steering committees) that it was expected to adopt, the environmental management
TA missed an opportunity to create foundations for a more productive and durable relationship
between the central and state environmental agencies (or among state agencies). Some of the
original ambitious plans for reinforcing project outcomes (feeding some TA outputs into Indian
Administrative Services courses, reporting on implementation of the TA in India's Annual State
of Environment Report) have not materialized. In view of this, sustainability of outcomes is seen
as less likely from an overall cluster perspective.

73.    As far as the individual components are concerned:
       (i)     Component A's outputs did not see any significant follow-up from either MOEF,
               SPCBs, or ADB to build further on the action plan blueprint developed for
               promotion of ESP. Discussions held during the independent evaluation mission
               (IEM) with staff of MOEF and other officials involved revealed how little they
               could recall of the component. Couple this with the dominant effect of the outputs
               produced by the World Bank's EMCBP and NEERI at the same time and took the
               lead in contributing toward the revised EIA Notification of 2006. Component A's
               outputs and consequently, the outcomes, only had an outside chance of
               withstanding the waning effect of time. Although the component is unsustainable
               in its own right, it is expected that India will steadily but surely implement policies
62    Appendix 3



              toward environment-friendly economic investment both nationally and in the
              states, including related tools and techniques. This, to some degree, is reflected
              in the maturity of the country safeguard systems, and assistance from either
              international financial institutions or national initiatives will continue to improve
              environmental management in India. On balance, sustainability is still considered
              less likely as far as attribution to component A is concerned.
      (ii)    Component B was cancelled.
      (iii)   Component C's sustainability was saved by the inclusion of additional activity 1
              on GIS training for MPPCB staff, which gave them a tangible tool to demonstrate
              GIS applications toward environmentally sound project planning; they continue to
              use that tool effectively to this day and even share it with some other SPCBs.
              However, little evidence can be found of the fate of other intended outcomes of
              the original component, such as legislative processes for better environmental
              management; nor have the case studies conducted at Indore and Pithampur
              industrial estate generated any further take-up in the state's environmental
              establishment. Rated less likely sustainable.
      (iv)    For Component D to have an enduring impact, it needed to be associated with a
              financial institution, e.g., the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
              or the Small Industrial Development Bank of India, which could have
              demonstrated the practical application of the principles of cleaner production
              financing to SMEs and other stakeholders. The TA, therefore, lacked a home or
              mentor who could nurture the product. Until the draft final report stage, the
              component lacked a demonstrable outcome, and subsequently a pilot self-
              assessment toolkit was developed for use by SMEs. Although financial closure
              was achieved on adoption of cleaner production by one SME during the TA
              project's tenure, the IEM saw no evidence of the TA outcomes being used by the
              industry and stakeholders or that the financial model developed by the
              component was being replicated with or without modifications. Demonstration
              projects have had limited success in persuading non-involved enterprises to
              begin cleaner production activities on their own. Most banks in India do not
              perform any environmental risk assessment before lending, and financing is
              largely made available on the strength of an SME's balance sheet. Sustainability
              is, therefore, less likely. Box A3.2 demonstrates some of the challenges facing
              cleaner production financing in developing countries.

        Box A3.2: Challenges to Financing of Cleaner Production in Developing Countries
Commercial bank loans are considered unattractive due to high interest rates and unattractive terms for
loans. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) require low-interest, long-term loans for cleaner
production projects. Procedure for borrowing money from commercial banks is often considered
complicated and costly.
Due diligence mainly considers the financial strength of applicants without paying much heed to
technical rationale.
The banks to adapt from simply financing process modifications to financing production plant,
composition of raw materials and intermediary products, and product design.
Governments to consider providing an enabling environment including incentives for SMEs to go beyond
compliance and adopt cleaner production as a production efficiency measure, e.g., tax breaks for import
of cleaner production technologies, highlighting advantages over end-of-pipe technologies.

         (v)      Component E had the full support of WBPCB, and discussions with its
                  stakeholders during the IEM revealed that its products, e.g., wetlands zone
                  inventory maps and the administrative orders targeting pollution from
                  construction activities are positive outcomes that continue to be used. Mapping of
                  wetlands undertaken by the component helped develop an action plan for
                  maintenance of the East Kolkata wetlands (declared a Ramsar site in 2002)
                  managed by the East Kolkata Wetlands Management Authority, which was
                  established under the State Legislation in 2006 as per the East Kolkata Wetlands
                  (Conservation and Management) Act of 2006. The wetlands zone mapping
                  methodology has also been shared with SPCBs of other states. This trend is
                  likely sustainable.
         (vi)     Additional activity 1 (GIS training of MPPCB staff) resulted in development of
                  skills of MPPCB staff that continue to be applied; other activities (2­3) have not
                  shown further development and progress. Activities 4, 5, and 6 were stand-alone
                  training events that concluded with the TA. Sustainability rating, hence, unlikely.

E.       Other Assessments

74.      Impact. After listing the many things that went wrong with the TA, it would be overstating
the criticisms to conclude that the project made no impact whatsoever. A sympathetic observer
will argue that component A did make a small contribution to the passage of the EIA Notification
Act of 2006,14 probably an improvement on the EIA provisions of 1986 Environment (Protection)
Rules and 1994 Environmental Notification Act.15 Although unanticipated at the time of TA
formulation, GIS-based applications have boosted the capacity of MPPCB (component C). The
financing dimension of cleaner production found few takers under the implementation
arrangements chosen for component D, but the topic of cleaner production itself is alive at
MOEF, and the component can take some credit for that. Component E's work on wetlands and
air pollution in West Bengal has proven its usefulness, as the results were institutionalized to a
significant degree. More broadly, the TA demonstrated to the Government of India ADB's
commitment to improving environmental management in India. Regardless of the limited
outcomes of the project, ADB is considered a serious and steady partner (even if a better
"financier" than a source of technical know-how) by both the Ministry of Finance and MOEF. On
balance, the overall impact is rated moderate.

75.      ADB performance. ADB initially overstated the degree of ownership of the TA by the
state client or at least did not sufficiently appreciate the associated challenges. The consequences
of this were serious: delays, abandonment of a large component (component B), and the need to
engage in expensive reformulation of other components (C and E, and in part, D).

76.     ADB's own ownership during the initial period (2000­2002) was questionable. ADB
headquarters administered the TA, but responsibility was scattered and no single individual
seemed to be in charge of the whole cluster. Communication among implementing agencies,
consultants, and ADB was complex and unproductive. That situation improved once ADB bit the
bullet and transferred administrative oversight to the resident mission early in 2003, transferred
an ADB staff solely responsible for the TA to the resident mission, and appointed (almost
14
   The notification provides clearer rules for environmental clearance by the central or state governments, sets out the
   rules applying to category A and B projects, and formalizes the sequence of environmental clearance activities
   (screening, scoping, public consultation, and appraisal).
15
   Not everybody shares this view. Some (e.g., Federation of Indian Mineral Industries) see a trend toward further
   bureaucratization and further slowing of the process of environmental clearance, and consider component A as
   having contributed to this trend. The fact that the EIA Notification of 2006 has required an unusually large number
   of amendments since its adoption, in part supports this view.
64     Appendix 3



3 years late) a TA coordinator operating from the resident mission. These individuals, by then
ably supported by ADB headquarters, identified and formulated additional activities, and saw the
TA implementation through to its end in 2007.

77.     ADB did not demand greater clarity of implementation arrangements, especially the
responsibilities of MOEF in relation to the SPCBs, or ensure a properly functioning steering
committee. The TA technical committee began operating only in 2003 (with the resident
mission's Infrastructure and the Environment Unit as secretariat). The failure to appoint a TA
coordinator from the outset lacked justification and is likely to have been among the major
causes of poor performance during the initial period. ADB was slow to pick up on a potential
conflict of interest when the National Productivity Council was being considered as
implementing agency for component D.

78.     Like many other ADB TA projects (including some included in this TPER), the TA and its
components had in most cases overly broad TOR (ironically, with the possible exception of the
cancelled component B). This led to production of too many outputs, the majority of which found
no audience. Given the de facto unraveling of the cluster, the TA's DMF, logical and elegant as
it was, proved insufficient to monitor performance.

79.    ADB deserves high marks for stamina and dogged pursuit of an honorable outcome.
Even if the TA was unsuccessful, ADB has not lost credibility. Performance, on balance and
when considered over the 7-year implementation, can at best be rated less than satisfactory.

80.    Executing and implementing agencies' performance. The signing of the TA
agreement was delayed. MOEF, the executing agency, had not clearly signaled to ADB the
extent of forthcoming duplication under component A.

81.     The commitment of implementing agencies varied over time, and changes in key staffing
positions resulted in a desire to change the TA scope (especially in the case of components B
and E). In spite of its best efforts, GPCB was unable to formulate a constructive position on the
best use of TA funds and when it finally did, the component had been cancelled. By contrast,
the WBPCB soon formulated a clear picture of priorities that made it easier to modify
component E's scope. Once that happened, the implementing agency's commitment was total
and good results were achieved.

82.    Appointment of MOEF to implement component D was not an appropriate decision. MOEF
was not equipped technically to deal with issues of cleaner production financing, and the result
was a mismatch of TA activities and MOEF expectations, which led to a long hiatus in effective
communications between TA consultant and implementing agency, and much meandering further
on. Rated less than satisfactory for components A and D; and satisfactory for C and E.

F.     Issues, Lessons, and Follow-Up Actions

83.     Issues. Environmental improvements rarely depend on technical answers alone but
need to consider governance and cultural aspects in India. Cleaner production mainstreaming
and financing, for instance, requires much better information about performance (quantity of
inputs, efficiency, etc.). Any innovation that demands better monitoring threatens established
interests, many of which thrive on an opaque environment (e.g., for the purpose of tax evasion).
This dimension has not been studied enough in ADB's past environment-related assistance but
may well come to the fore as new assistance mechanisms that crucially depend on reliable
monitoring (e.g., reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) gain importance.
                                                                                              Appendix 3        65



84.      Improvement of EIA procedures and practices is a complex matter. Provisions are not better
simply by being more recent. The risk to ADB environmental assistance is that it could become a
tool of greater bureaucratization (and component A came pretty close to being just that) rather than
a vehicle of reform. To avoid this risk, regulatory reform and any TA supporting it require close
involvement of regulatory practitioners, arguably underrepresented in the TA. The reform of the EIA
system in India is far from over, judging by the growing--rather than diminishing--overload of the
environmental clearance system that is in place.
85.     Environmental management in India is largely, but not completely, decentralized. EIA
Notification of 2006 brought some clarity into the subject, but the roles of MOEF on the one
hand, and of SPCBs or state departments of environment on the other, are interpreted
differently by different parties. Coordination and consultation between MOEF and SPCBs
appears could have been improved (and the TA is a missed opportunity to improve it). Further
efforts toward an unambiguous interpretation of the roles of central and state authorities in
environmental matters is justified.

86.     Lessons. The experience of the TA suggests that their impact on implementation of TA
projects' institutions matters, but individuals in those institutions matter even more. In planning
future TA, it is important for ADB to anticipate likely changes in the senior ranks of executing
and implementing agencies and seek arrangements that shield TA projects from waning
commitment because of a change in leadership.

87.     ADB needs to wean itself from the notion that broader is necessarily better. Overly broad
TORs tend to hide an uncertain grasp of key issues. The result is excessive cost and duration of
the project, and a rising gap between the volume of consultant outputs and the readiness of the
client to use them. ADB should have the confidence to ask for less in volume and more in
substance, and should not write complex TORs unless it is sure that this is what is required.
ADB fails to do its job not by writing lean TORs, but by doing the opposite.

88.      The cluster model of TA has its place in the arsenal of ADB assistance and can be
justified by administrative efficiency--or corporate reasons alone (rather than necessarily
requiring a more complex rationale).16 Regardless of the reasons, however, the model will in
most cases require dedicated ADB personnel and continued involvement. In the case of the
environmental management TA, this vital ingredient materialized too late. Equally important for
TA clusters is early institutionalization of the implementation plan and supervision framework.
Here, too, the TA fell short.

89.      The choice of the right implementing agency for a TA project (or its component) remains
essential. Component D offers a lesson: an implementing agency (National Productivity Council,
in this case) unsuitable from a governance point of view was replaced by an implementing agency
(MOEF) unsuitable from a technical point of view, while organizations potentially better suited for
the role (e.g., financial institutions such as the Small Industries Development Bank of India or
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India) were overlooked.

90.     Follow-up actions. ADB should maintain close contact with MOEF and follow current
discussions on a possible creation of India's independent Environment Protection Agency with a
view to studying possible loan and TA that support that step with its considerable governance
virtues; and follow the functioning of EIA Notification of 2006 and accept the idea that ADB
16
     It is worth keeping in mind that the idea of clustering may run counter to the idea of decentralization (of
     environmental management). The experience of the TA suggests that decentralized formulation of priorities makes
     them more stable than if priority setting is subordinated to a centralized design.
66     Appendix 3



involvement should not stop once something is institutionalized, but should extend to learning
how well the new arrangements operate (monitor outcomes, in short).

91.     It would be useful for ADB to review the outputs of additional activities undertaken as
part of the TA to see which one might be suitable for a follow-up. Among possible candidates
might be the establishment of an EMI in North East India or a variety of GIS and EMI
applications in different states.

            CAPACITY BUILDING FOR CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM ­ INDIA

A.        Summary

1.     The technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM) was formulated to develop the capacity of India's governmental and regulatory entities,
stakeholders at state, urban local, municipality and rural levels, and project developers and
promoters to formulate projects to be supported by CDM.1 The TA targeted the non-energy
components of the CDM market, focusing particularly on municipalities and urban local bodies,
small-scale municipal or rural CDM activities; and the finance sector.

2.      The TA had strong support of the government, and it complemented activities of
development partners (GTZ, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank)
in India. Its timing coincided with the formulation of India's national strategy study for CDM. The
TA was well embedded in the country assistance strategy of the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) and linked to the expanding ADB portfolio of climate change-related assistance and
development of energy efficiency initiative and carbon finance initiative.

3.      Implemented between 2005 and 2007, the TA provided on-the-job training in project
design document (PDD) formulation and conducted a number of technical and information
workshops for municipal bodies, urban local bodies and the finance industry. It helped develop
two PDDs for projects in Guwahati and Okhla (national capital territory) and two small-scale
rural sector CDM projects. It formulated an action plan and strategy document for municipalities
and urban local bodies with a focus on municipal solid waste. A toolkit was also developed to
guide small-scale CDM project developers without previous CDM experience. A concept of
business plan for a CDM fund was drafted. Hosted by the TA executing agency, the Ministry of
Environment and Forest (MOEF), an international conference to discuss the TA results was held
back-to-back with the International Emissions Trading Association's annual CDM conference in
April 2007 in Delhi.

4.     The TA proved to be relevant to the needs of India and a good vehicle for transmitting
ADB's expanding experience in the subject matter to India. The PDDs developed under the TA
were not taken all the way to registration, and this has reduced TA effectiveness somewhat. The
impact of the training undertaken by the TA is expected to generate positive results in the
months and years to come.

5.     The TA is rated relevant, less effective, less efficient, and less likely sustainable (with
doubts about the future of the CDM itself). Overall, it is rated partly successful.

B.        Introduction

6.      Evaluation purpose and process. More than 3 years have passed since TA
completion. The evaluation took place in the field during 21­25 June 2010, preceded by detailed
desk review of relevant documentation. The evaluation team interviewed the current staff of
MOEF, including the senior officer in charge of the TA, pertinent ADB staff in headquarters and
the India Resident Mission, as well as selected consultants involved in TA implementation. The
evaluation team had access to TA-related documentation, including the TA completion report,
which rates it partly successful.

    Details of the TA projects are in Appendix 1. They are not footnoted when they are referred to in the text.
68        Appendix 4



7.     Technical assistance objectives. The goal of the TA was to promote greenhouse gas
(GHG) emission-reducing projects in India under the CDM. It was to provide broad-based
capacity-building support to various stakeholders in specific CDM sectors and selected areas,
and strengthen India's overall position as one of the key players in the evolving international
carbon market.

C.        Design and Implementation

8.      Rationale. As one of the crucial vehicles of multilateral cooperation directed at tackling
the issue of global climate change consistent with the overall objectives of environmental
protection, the CDM fits in well with ADB's overall operational strategy for assistance to India as
described in its country strategy and program (CSP 2003­2006).2

9.      The Government of India, in collaboration with multilateral and bilateral development
partners, was preparing a national CDM strategy that would largely coincide with the coming
into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005.3 Capacity-building initiatives were launched to
create a local base of CDM expertise, primarily among energy sector project developers and
promoters. The TA was conceived to complement and expand these capacity-building initiatives
of the government by extending coverage to non-energy components of the CDM market and
capacity-building needs of the state, municipality, local, and rural stakeholders and the finance
and risk insurance industry.

10.     Formulation. ADB fact-finding of 2004 established that favorable conditions existed to
undertake the TA project. In particular, ADB observed that timing for the TA would be suitable,
and there was a clearly articulated demand for the TA by MOEF (ADB, March 2004). The
concept was consistent with ADB's overall operational strategy for assistance to India and in
line with its climate change initiatives.4 The TA's activities were based on discussions with the
counterparts and assessment of issues and development needs identified in various sectors of
the CDM regime in India, and were considered complementary to capacity-building initiatives of
the government and other multilateral and bilateral development agencies (footnote 3). The TA
was included in ADB's TA program (CSP update 2004)..5

11.    The TA was to focus on governmental and regulatory entities (National Clean
Development Mechanism Authority and state, municipal, urban-local, and rural stakeholders)
and project developers and promoters. It was to address the non-energy components of the
CDM market, particularly municipalities and urban local bodies; small-scale municipal or rural
CDM activities; and the financial sector (banks, insurers), and build corresponding capacity.

12.   Cost, financing, and executing arrangements. The total TA cost was estimated at
$900,000 equivalent, comprising $425,000 in foreign exchange and $475,000 in local currency.

    This was part of the National Strategy Study Program (National Joint Implementation/CDM Strategy Studies
    Program) of the World Bank. The program was initiated in 1997 by the Government of Switzerland and the World
    Bank. The objective was to build capacity of the Joint Implementation/CDM host countries to take advantage of the
    Kyoto Protocol flexibility mechanisms that promote trade of GHG emission reductions. The program was officially
    launched in 2005 (TERI. 2005. CDM Implementation in India: The National Strategy Study. TERI Press, Delhi).
    Also of relevance to the TA are (i) GTZ CDM-India Program, a capacity-building initiative implemented since 2003
    by GTZ and the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (Ministry of Power) under the Indo-German Energy Program (IGEN);
    and (ii) the United Nations Development Programme's Regional Strategy for CDM in Asia and the Pacific Region
    (1994­1996).

The TA was to be administered by ADB, using $700,000 contributed as a grant by the
Government of Canada and by an in-kind contribution worth $200,000 by the Government of
India.6

13.    The TA document envisaged implementation to be closely coordinated with MOEF and
other stakeholders and interested parties, including the private sector, financial institutions,
insurance companies, and civil society organizations. MOEF was designated the TA's executing
agency. It was agreed to create a CDM development coordination committee, chaired by
MOEF, to coordinate pertinent activities of development partners.

14.     At ADB, the administrative responsibility for the TA was initially transferred from the
Energy Division of the South Asia Department (SAEN), which had intended to attach the TA to a
proposed loan to the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, to the Finance and
Infrastructure Division/Sustainable Transport Division of the Regional and Sustainable
Development Department (RSDD) in view of the latter's lead in ADB efforts directed at climate
change and CDM, and because at that time SAEN had staffing constraints. It remained involved
technically, however. In 2005, the administrative oversight returned to SAEN, which remained
responsible for the TA until its completion. RSDD thought that SAEN had by then developed the
capacity to oversee the implementation of the TA. Further, it was agreed that the RSDD should
be concentrating on regional activities, and country-specific TA projects should be carried out by
the regional departments.

15.     Consultants and scheduling. Twelve person-months of international consulting
services were envisaged in the areas of climate change policy formulation and international
negotiations, multisector CDM project development and processing, project-level financial and
economic analysis, institutional development, and financial risk management and fund
structuring, and 39 person-months of local consulting services in the areas of CDM project
development, financial analysis, renewable energy, climate change and CMD, and
computerized project management systems. These services were delivered largely as planned.
All up, 55 person-months were delivered, and the government expressed its satisfaction with the
consultants' performance.

16.     Approved by ADB in December 2004, the TA was to be completed by the end of July
2006. ADB later approved two extensions of the closing date. The first, to 31 July 2007, was to
compensate for (i) a delay in the signing of the TA agreement letter by the Ministry of Finance;
which resulted in the (ii) late fielding of the international consultant. The second, to
31 December 2007, was to allow the completion of four PDDs that proved to be more difficult
than originally anticipated. In reaching out to municipalities, the TA faced a new and
inexperienced audience, data collection was time-consuming, and some projects had to be
replaced midstream because of loss of support by original project promoters. The financial
closure of the TA was also delayed, which can be attributed to issues relating to the withholding
of TA funds that took time to resolve and caused the delay in the final payment. The TA was
financially closed on 20 February 2009.

17.     Design changes. Only minor changes were made in the project design. Additional
assistance (2 person-months by the CDM project development specialist) was agreed to be
provided through the government to the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board in 2007 to
assist in preparing a carbon market development strategy for Himachal Pradesh. Agreed also in
2007 was additional assistance (2 person-months by CDM specialist) to hold a consultation with
6
    Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate Change, administered through the Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency,
    and Climate Change (REACH) Program.
70        Appendix 4



up to 200 state utilities to facilitate identification of power sector projects suitable for support
under CDM. The proposed modifications were considered minor, involving less than 15% of the
TA's total cost and not altering its objectives.
18.       Outputs. The TA was to produce the following outputs:
          (i)    staff of the National Clean Development Mechanism Authority and other relevant
                 national stakeholders and urban local bodies (and municipalities) in selected
                 states, and project developers and promoters trained to assess and evaluate
                 CDM projects using GHG-reducing technologies such as landfill gas capture,
                 waste-to-energy, etc.; and two best-practice CDM methodologies and PDDs
                 prepared for these sectors;
          (ii)  an action plan and strategy document developed to replicate CDM projects in
                 municipalities and urban local bodies;
          (iii)  two best-practice CDM methodologies and PDDs prepared, and associated project
                 bundling mechanisms and financial structuring options formulated (in close
                 cooperation with suitable banks) for selected small-scale CDM sectors such as
                 rural (decentralized) energy supply, small-industry clusters, etc.;
          (iv)  an operational toolkit and handbook prepared for small-scale CDM projects;
          (v)    a CDM project appraisal and risk-management toolkit developed for the domestic
                 finance and insurance sector;
          (vi)  staff of selected institutions from the finance and insurance sector trained in
                 appraisal, risk management, and structuring of CDM projects; and
          (vii)  the feasibility of a dedicated fund for CDM projects assessed and the fund design
                 developed.
19.       Listed below are the actual TA outputs.

20.    Four workshops targeting municipal bodies and urban local bodies were held in Mumbai
(24 January 2006), Delhi (28 June 2006), Bangalore (1 December 2006), and Kolkata (13 June
2007). The workshops, attended by about 200 participants, provided basic introduction to CDM;
in-depth discussion of specific CDM project types relevant to the municipal sector (waste
management, energy efficiency); and a presentation of real-life case studies such as Guwahati
composting project.
21.    Two PDDs in Gujarat and Okhla were developed from a call for project proposals issued
to 60 municipalities and urban local bodies through MOEF in October 2006.
22.    An action plan and strategy document for municipalities and urban local bodies, with a
focus on municipal solid waste, was developed by the international consultant to promote basic
understanding of the CDM among municipal officers and other stakeholders concerned with
municipal solid waste. The plan recommended to set up national CDM facilitation cells in
municipalities and urban local bodies as centers of know-how and a platform for data exchange.
23.     Two small-scale rural sector projects (a cluster of rice mills and solar-thermal driers for fruit
and vegetables) were chosen for PDD development in consultation with MOEF and made ready
for host country approval and validation.7 Since the costs associated with these steps, especially

    The National CDM Authority is a single-window clearance facility for CDM projects in India. Project proponents are
    required to submit project concept note and project design document. The authority examines the documents and
    seeks clarification from the proponents on any preliminary queries. The proposals are then put up for consideration
    by the authority. The proponents and their consultants are normally given about 10­15 days' notice to come to an
    authority meeting and give a brief presentation of their CDM proposals. Authority members can seek further
    clarifications at the meeting. Once the authority is satisfied, host country approval is granted.

validation, are a significant barrier for both projects, the consultant recommended that MOEF and
ADB consider providing support up to the completion of the validation, but for want of financial
support such validation did not occur.

24.     A toolkit was devised to guide small-scale CDM project developers without previous
CDM experience in the advancement of their proposals. The toolkit describes the types and
categories of small-scale projects, explains the CDM cycle, the concept of baseline and
additionality, monitoring methodologies, the possibility of bundling several projects into one
design document, and the approach to negotiating sales of certified emission reductions
(CERs). It deals with those aspects of the PDD that are unlikely to undergo fundamental change
in the near future. A toolkit for project appraisal and risk management for CDM projects in the
finance sector was also devised.

25.    Four workshops for the finance industry and co-hosted in one case by the Ministry of
Finance were organized in Mumbai (23 January 2006), back-to-back with the municipality
workshop (para. 20); Delhi (29 June 2006), back-to-back with the municipality workshop; Delhi
(28 December 2006) for senior management of financial institutions; and Mumbai (29 December
2006). About 200 persons attended and expressed satisfaction with the presentations, and with
the ensuing discussion and results.

26.    A business plan concept for a CDM fund was drafted by the consultant. Although it is not
believed that the CDM fund concept has taken off as envisaged in the TA, some stakeholders in
the Indian finance sector have engaged in renewable energy and carbon financing, but not
necessarily along the lines envisaged in the fund concept.

27.     Hosted by MOEF, an international conference to discuss the results of the TA was held
back-to-back with the International Emissions Trading Association's annual CDM conference on
17­18 April 2007 in Delhi. It featured 22 speakers, of which 13 represented international
organizations. Participants represented India's municipal and finance sectors and the
international carbon market community. About 180 persons attended.

28.     Policy framework. The Government of India ratified the Kyoto Protocol of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in August 2002 and approved
the establishment of the National CDM Authority in December 2003. Since then, India has
considerably expanded its CDM market, but barriers to faster progress still exist and some of
these were acutely felt at the time of TA formulation. They include lack of awareness about
energy-efficiency and GHG reduction benefits; limited information about energy-efficiency and
GHG mitigation measures; dependence on local technology suppliers and old, inefficient
technology; lack of technical know-how and organizational capacity by national institutions; and
financial barriers to CDM projects linked to the often high initial investment and difficulties of
bundling small-size CDM projects for financing.

29.    In India, ADB was able to apply its CDM-related experience acquired in several other
developing member countries (DMCs) since 2002, mainly through its Renewable Energy,
Energy Efficiency, and Climate Change (REACH) Program.8 In August 2003, ADB established a
CDM facility for risk-free assistance in preparing and processing CDM components of ADB's
loan projects in DMCs. The facility did not purchase emission reduction credits but helped

72         Appendix 4



identify potential buyers of such credits generated by CDM projects and eased their transactions
with the DMCs. The facility's objective clearly complemented the direction of the TA.

30.     The TA was consistent with important elements of ADB's overall operational strategy for
assistance to India described in its CSP 2003­2006 (footnote 2), as well as ADB's Energy
Policy 2000.9 Among its sector and thematic priorities, the CSP includes environmental
protection, including support for projects that use environment-friendly sources of power such as
renewable energy and hydropower; are energy efficient; and promote the use of cleaner fuel to
protect the urban environment. The policy paper recommends ADB's assistance to DMCs for
introducing policy reforms aimed at promoting clean energy projects, including renewable
energy and energy efficiency, and enabling access to climate change incentives such as those
available through CDM.

D.         Performance Assessment

31.     Overall assessment. The TA was a well-justified and well-timed initiative to further
strengthen India's role in the operation of the CDM by boosting capacity to formulate suitable
CDM projects and thus contribute to moderation of the country's GHG emissions. The TA had
strong support from the government, was effective in its training and dissemination activities, but
less effective in seeing the CDM process through to projects' registration. It was for the most
part competently implemented, except for the significant delays that occurred and that could
have been better planned for. The sustainability of the direction promoted by the TA appears
less likely, however, given the challenges faced by the municipal sector and the current
uncertainty about the future of the CDM after 2012. The TA is rated relevant, less effective, less
efficient, and less likely sustainable, and partly successful overall.

32.    Relevance. The TA came at the right time and targeted a relatively neglected segment of
the potential CDM market in India. The municipal and rural sectors tend to be overlooked in the
CDM process, which so far was more inclined to reward big GHG reductions with often a limited
development impact (hydrofluorocarbon reductions being a striking example of this weakness).

33.     The TA had strong and unwavering support from MOEF throughout its implementation in
a testimony to its relevance and importance to the domestic side. The TA is rated relevant.

34.    Effectiveness. The TA delivered training to a broad range of institutions effectively.
There is no question that the understanding of the CDM administrative cycle and ability to
formulate CDM projects has improved as a result.

35.    The TA document was not sufficiently precise in asking the consultant team to "prepare"
PDDs, leaving the vital distinction between the drafting of such documents and subsequent host
country approval and validation, and registration by UNFCCC, unanswered. Of the four PDDs
prepared under the TA (Guwahati, Okhla, and two rural projects), it is the understanding of the
independent evaluation mission (IEM) that only Okhla was registered so far.10 This has reduced
the TA's effectiveness. The attribution of new registered India CDM projects to the TA
(approximately 100 such new projects have been registered since the TA's completion) risks
being arbitrary, and the view is taken that only a small percentage of them is likely to have
benefited from the activities of the TA. On balance, and combining strong training results with
few concrete achievements on the project development front, the TA is rated less effective.

36.     Efficiency. The TA was implemented competently but for the significant delays that
occurred. The program was ambitious to begin with, especially considering that PDDs had to be
prepared through a process of public advertisements. Undisbursed funds of the TA's final year
were used constructively for related activities in Himachal Pradesh and for capacity building by
public utilities (para. 17). On balance, the TA is rated less efficient.

37.      Sustainability. It is difficult to separate the sustainability of the TA direction from the fate
of the CDM after 2012, when the original Kyoto Protocol comes to an end. The future of the post-
2012 trading regime is far from certain. Apart from this, the TA identified a theme that is unlikely to
lose relevance suddenly. The type of competence developed under the TA can be used flexibly
under a variety of modifications to future carbon trading arrangements. The government has a
strong vested interest in supporting future carbon trading. Having said that, the CDM fund
proposed by the TA and the lack of significant progress on the validation of projects show that
absence of financing and associated institutional support still plagues the development of CDM
activities at the municipal level, despite its high potential. On balance, the direction supported by
the TA is less likely sustainable.

E.      Other Assessments

38.     Impact . India is the second-biggest source of CERs in the United Nation's CDM after the
People's Republic of China. According to UNFCCC data, India has 498 CDM projects registered
to date. In total, 78.2 million CERs (currently worth $1.24 billion) have been issued to Indian
projects, representing 19.6% of all CERs issued globally to date. Viewed in that context and
when assessed against the challenges that still remain in CDM development at the municipal
level, the TA's impact may seem moderate. A closer look at the structure of registered PDDs
reveals that the majority of those in India were formulated by the energy, and iron and steel
sectors, which were the first to master the CDM administrative processes. By contrast, the CDM
TA targeted lagging sectors (municipal bodies, rural sector, and financial institutions). It is
reasonable to expect that the impact of the TA will be felt in the months and years to come.

39.      The TA contributed to a solid understanding of CDM-linked opportunities and
development of CDM-compatible projects by the country's financial institutions. There remains
little need for basic awareness building on CDM opportunities and risks. The understanding is
somewhat less complete in the municipal sector, but it has significantly improved.

40.    ADB performance. ADB recognized an excellent opportunity to assist and did so in
awareness of the activities of development partners, both implementers and financiers. Timely
discussions with Canada's Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation Office
prevented possible duplication with the World Bank's Carbon Finance-Assist Program in India.

41.     ADB mobilized adequate staff resources from the outset of TA implementation. The TA's
administrative oversight by ADB headquarters was appropriate given the TA's close link with a
rapidly evolving area of ADB technical engagement and consequent need for in-house technical
coordination. Its performance can be rated satisfactory.

42.    Executing agency performance. MOEF assigned a senior staff who remained in
charge of TA execution to the end, supporting the TA with dedication and enthusiasm. This
contributed in no small measure to the TA's positive outcome. Performance rated satisfactory.
74     Appendix 4



F.     Issues, Lessons, and Follow-Up Actions

43.     Issues. Functioning of the CDM is a complex and often controversial subject. Besides its
uncertain future, there are factors such as (i) periodic changes in CDM rules and procedures
that affect the understanding of the mechanism; (ii) the often significant transaction cost of the
CDM projects; (iii) complexity of host country approval and validation arrangements; (iv) lack of
funding to take CDM projects to the registration stage; (v) difficulty of bundling small-size CDM
projects; and (vi) obstacles to widening the CDM reach from sectors such as energy, and iron
and steel to other activities. This means that projects such as the CDM TA cannot be seen as
"once and for all" interventions but are periodic injections into an evolving process. It also
suggests that ADB and the Government of India would do well to maintain dialogue on the
pattern of that evolution and seek best ways to respond.

44.     The politicization of the topic of climate change has resulted in a reluctance to focus on
the question of actual measurement of countries' GHG emissions. The data are for the most
part self-reported and unverified. The CDM projects with their verification protocol are the bright
spot on that landscape. The ultimate impact of the CDM TA depends crucially on the ability to
attribute new registered CDM projects to it and calculate their combined GHG reduction. This is
not possible at this point.

45.     Lessons. Given the large number of stakeholders and a demanding institutional setting,
municipal CDM projects tend to be significantly more complex than those in the energy or
industry sectors. Their sometimes lower GHG reduction benefits can be outweighed by high
development benefits. Among urban solid waste management options, waste composting
appears to be particularly well suited to Indian conditions, and carbon finance can tip the scales
from marginal to substantial economic profitability.

46.      Learning by doing, the approach used by the TA toward developing PDD formulation
skills, remains highly desirable in a variety of TA projects.

47.   Additional demonstration projects, particularly if they enhance existing               CDM
methodologies, could encourage the development of a small-scale CDM sector.

48.     Recommendations. For reasons stated in para. 45, it would be important to give
greater publicity to concrete and replicable success stories of municipal CDM projects in India,
and continue to support--beyond the progress achieved by the CDM TA--training of India's
managers of municipal services and city officials in the design and administration of CDM
projects.

49.     There remain several important CDM subtopics that might justify separate attention in
India. One of them is the approach to be taken by the finance sector to carbon revenues in the
context of lending decisions, and also the government's policy on taxation of carbon revenues.
A "carbon credit accounting TA" might be a way to address these issues.

50.    With MOEF approval, the TA experience (including case studies) should be made
available online for the benefit of other DMCs with potentially similar CDM projects.

51.    MOEF would do well to make arrangements for early recognition (and updating) of
potential CDM projects, especially in the public sector, to reduce uncertainties and delays in
data collection, baseline determination, and promoter support, and to attract commercial
cofinancing.

      INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
                                 ­ SRI LANKA

A.        Summary

1.     The technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening for Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) was a significant addition to donor-supported initiatives in the 1990s aimed at
strengthening environmental safeguards in Sri Lanka.1

2.      The TA was closely aligned with the policies and priorities of the government, which had
earlier adopted rules that made environmental assessment obligations more specific, and
promulgated a system of environmental safeguards that created the possibility of the Central
Environmental Authority (CEA) outsourcing environmental oversight to other suitable agencies
of the government. The TA approach could have been better targeted, however, by working with
a selected group of project-approving agencies (PAA) and provincial authorities in piloting the
EIA reform process alongside CEA; as it happened, the effort was spread far too thin,
preventing strong engagement from the agencies. On balance, and given the obvious
importance of the subject matter and close coordination with similar activities of other
development partners, the TA is partly relevant.

3.      The TA produced a number of outputs, among which detailed analyses of the EIA
process, ways of integrating environmental concerns into the planning procedures of
government agencies, and the environmental capacity of PAAs stand out. These resulted in a
variety of recommendations and were combined with training and dissemination workshops
aimed at diverse stakeholders. Other major outputs of the TA included (i) recommendations for
improvements of the EIA-related appeals procedures, (ii) recommendations for establishing
provincial structures of environmental assessment, (iii) introduction to strategic environmental
assessment (SEA) and steps to mainstreaming it, (iv) development and/or improvement of EIA-
related databases, and (v) support to professionalize environmental assessment activities.

4.       The process of consolidation and further improvement of environmental safeguards that
appeared to be making good strides a decade ago, buoyed by the TA and other donor-
supported initiatives, appears to have stalled. Even after factoring in cultural aspects, EIA
practices in Sri Lanka today appear curiously (given the major earlier efforts referred to)
incipient. It is tempting to blame the civil strife of the last 20 years for this state of affairs, but the
causes are more complicated. They include unresolved governance issues that create potential
conflict of interest in the environmental work of some PAAs, continued lack of certification of EIA
practitioners, and EIA reporting bereft of the primary data on which EIA conclusions are
(presumably) based, which is due to problems of access to data in general. Add to these the
more familiar problems of attrition of qualified staff in government agencies, weak enforcement
and monitoring, and a variety of budget constraints. Contrary to expectations at the time and
with only one exception (North Western Province), environmental assessment in Sri Lanka
remains centralized. Viewed in this light and with the benefit of hindsight, the TA is rated less
effective.

5.     The TA was almost completed within the planned implementation period. It was marked
by a responsive and activist performance of the consultant team and a good rapport between
the TA team and the government, as well as a complications-free TA administration. In that
sense, the TA was efficient.

1
    Details of the TA projects are in Appendix 1. They are not footnoted when they are referred to in the text.
                                                                               Appendix 5      77



6.      ADB correctly diagnosed the need to improve environmental safeguards in Sri Lanka
and formulated the TA with due recognition and understanding of the activities of development
partners and the preferences of the government. It underestimated some of the governance
issues (conflicts of interest, credibility of EIA reports, etc.), which were obscured by the many
detailed activities of the TA and became apparent only much later. The executing agency
cooperated fully and constructively with ADB and the TA consultants.

7.       The original direction of the TA is rated less likely sustainable. What is needed at this
stage is not so much technical details or environmental assessment methodologies (Sri Lankan
institutions such as the Center for Environmental Studies can provide those), but a review and
modification of the overall structure that would include a reappraisal of the CEA, the PAA model,
a return to the topic of EIA decentralization, a fundamental reform of access to primary data,
stronger credibility of EIAs and their conduct, and measures that reduce bureaucratization of the
environmental assessment process without losing its substance.

8.     Overall, the TA is rated partly successful.

B.     Introduction

9.    Evaluation purpose and process. The TA was completed more than 12 years ago.
While making it more difficult to reconstruct the story accurately, the long period since TA
completion provides a good opportunity to judge its longer-term impacts.

10.     The evaluation was fielded during 28 June­2 July 2010 after a detailed desk review of
documentation. The evaluation team interviewed the current staff of the Ministry of Forestry and
Environment (MFE), the TA executing agency, and its regulatory arm, the CEA; officials in other
central government agencies; and those in the North Western Province. The team discussed
the TA and related issues with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the
World Bank, and with several individuals acting as consultants or local implementers at the time
of the TA. The initial findings were discussed with the Sri Lanka Resident Mission, and
additional clarifications were sought from ADB headquarters staff involved in the TA's
implementation. The evaluation team had full access to TA-related documentation, including the
TA completion report, which rated the TA successful.

11.     Technical assistance objectives. The TA's objectives were improving the EIA process;
streamlining the environmental assessment process and using EIA process as a planning tool,
particularly by PAAs; developing the capacity of national institutions to use SEA; and building
capacity at subnational levels of government to carry out environmental assessment and
participate in environmental management.

C.     Design and Implementation

12.     Rationale. Sri Lanka's CEA was established in 1981 as an agency of the then Ministry
of Transport, Environment, and Women Affairs (MTEWA) in compliance with the National
Environmental Act of the preceding year. In line with worldwide trends, Order 772/72 of 1993
required all proponents of projects to submit the projects to an environmental assessment
process and prepare an EIA for those likely to have significant environmental impacts. Order
859/14 of 1995 provided for a system of environmental assessment that widened the range of
environmental assessment bodies from CEA to 14 sector ministries and 8 agencies of the
central government that could act as PAAs. The responsibility of environmental assessment
78     Appendix 5



was in principle divided among a number of agencies to become more manageable, but it was
not decentralized. With the exception of the North Western Province, environmental assessment
continued to take place at the central level.

13.      At the time of TA formulation, this structure was relatively new. A major project
supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) had earlier
identified weaknesses in the practice of environmental assessment and the EIA TA was
expected to help improve things.

14.   On the part of the government, the National Environmental Act and other official
documents committed it to sustainable economic development with adequate environmental
safeguards.

15.    Formulation. In establishing the TA scope, the TA paper considered the findings of the
1994 World Resource Institute study that compared EIA capacity in Indonesia, the Philippines,
and Sri Lanka. It also took into account the work of the USAID-funded Natural Resources and
Environment Policy Project (NAREPP) and ongoing activities of UNDP, the World Bank, and
others donors. Among these, the World Bank-supported Environmental Action 1 Program
(EA1P) was a natural complement of the EIA TA.

16.     Beneath the overarching objective of institutional strengthening for EIA, the TA was to
enhance environmental planning capability of project-formulating agencies of selected line
ministries; improve EIA guidelines and the EIA review process of PAAs, and augment
interagency coordination and cooperation in EIA implementation; bolster environmental planning
capabilities of planners and develop mechanisms for early incorporation of environmental
aspect in project planning; and strengthen the implementation of EIA by provincial councils.

17.     Cost, financing, and executing arrangements. The total TA cost was estimated at
$650,000 equivalent, consisting of $410,000 in foreign exchange and $240,000 equivalent in
local currency. It was financed by ADB using $600,000 contributed as a grant by the Japanese
Government, and by an in-kind contribution of the Government of Sri Lanka worth $50,000.

18.    MFE, in coordination with the Ministry of Finance and Planning, was the TA's executing
agency. Close coordination with the National Planning Department of the Ministry of Finance
and Planning was needed because some of the TA components and activities were linked to
UNDP's project in the department, "Assistance for Integrating Principles of Sustainable
Development into Economy-wide Policy and Planning." CEA, an agency of MFE, was to take a
major role in TA implementation. A project steering committee or project secretariat to be
chaired by the secretary of MFE was planned during inception stage. The committee was
supposed to provide guidance in overall TA implementation.

19.      Consultants and scheduling. The TA foresaw 12 person-months of international
consulting services in environmental management (EIA and institutional strengthening),
institutional analysis, and database management, and 39 person-months of local consultant
expertise in natural resources management, environmental management of industry and energy
development, database management, environmental law, and institutional development and
EIA.

20.    The TA was to be implemented over 17 months. In the event, this was extended by
2 months to accommodate additional activities requested by MFE (para. 21). Both ADB and the
executing agency commented positively on consultants' performance, especially their team
                                                                                  Appendix 5      79


spirit, ability to establish a cordial working relationship with the stakeholders, and the quality of
the consultative process, including the organization of 10 workshops.

21.    Design changes. No TA design changes were made. Small additional activities,
approved by ADB in 1998, included training and technical support for 10 environmental
associates that the MFE had recruited and assigned to principal PAAs; and a workshop for
senior ministerial staff and other policy officials on integrating environmental analysis with
economic development.

22.    Outputs. The anticipated and actual outputs are summarized below.

       1.      Initial Assessment of EIA Capacity in Sri Lanka

23.      Expected. A survey of EIA professionals and an initial workshop for senior government
officials from CEA, the National Planning Department, line ministries and PAAs, key EIA
practitioners, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and donor agencies concerned with EIA
implementation.

24.    Actual. An initiating workshop was held in Induruwa on 14­15 October 1997 to review
the TA's scope, provide a forum for discussion of ways to improve EIA in Sri Lanka, and refine
the TA's work plan. A report was produced, "The EIA Process in Sri Lanka: Background and
Current Developments." Representatives from government, private sector, and environmental
NGOs participated. An opinion survey was also conducted among EIA professionals.

       2.      Streamlining and Integrating Project Planning and Environmental Review
               Processes in Project-Approving Agencies

25.    Expected. The TA was to formulate a set of recommendations: (i) to MTEWA/MFE on
changes in EIA practices and in draft EIA guidelines for selected sectors, accompanied by training
design; (ii) to MTEWA/MFE on combining economic and environmental information in documents
and in project planning, accompanied by training design; (iii) changes to improve the PAA
environmental units; and (iv) on integrating environmental considerations into the planning
process for public investment projects and major private sector investment projects.

26.    Specialized training workshops for PAAs on coordinating the EIA process with other
elements of project planning, and a report on actions taken and further actions needed to
improve the role of the PAA environmental units were to be prepared, as was a report on the
Interagency Coordinating Committee's mandate and scope of activities. An interagency and
stakeholder mechanism for addressing EIA project problems was to be established, and advice
was to be provided to the ministry on policy issues on an as-needed basis.

27.    Revisions were to be made to draft procedures on EIA appeals and recommendations
made on best ways of incorporating environmental performance bonds, other performance
requirements, and economic performance incentives into project planning and EIA.

28.    Actual. A report on streamlining the EIA process was produced, along with a case study
used to establish a factual basis on the performance of the EIA process. Report was developed
through a comprehensive consultative process with a subcommittee of the PAA/EIA Interagency
Coordinating Committee, and presented with CEA and PAA at a workshop in July 1998.
80     Appendix 5



29.    Reports completed in 1998 were "Integrating Environmental Considerations in the
Planning Process for Public Sector Projects in Sri Lanka" and "Integrating Environmental
Consideration in the Planning Process of Private Sector Projects." The latter reviewed existing
private sector formulation procedures with regard to environmental issues and suggested
improvements in these procedures. "Institutional Appraisal of Environmental Units in the
Principal PAAs of the Government of Sri Lanka" was also produced.

30.     Workshops were organized for PAA officials and EIA practitioners on EIA objectives,
task management, and team leadership in Kandy (March 1998 for CEA and PAA officials, and
private EIA practitioners), Kandalama (June 1998 to consider ways to improve the link between
the EIA process and development planning in line ministries and agencies), and Lavinia
(July 1998 to alert PAA participants to actual and potential links between the EIA process for
public sector projects and broader project planning and review processes of the National
Planning Department).

31.    A report was completed on "Improving Interagency Coordination on Environmental
Assessment" that reviewed the EIA/PAA Interagency Coordinating Committee mechanisms,
evaluated its effectiveness, and suggested improvements.

32.    Regarding procedures for EIA administrative appeals, the TA's final report of September
1998 provided findings and recommendations based on the legal review of the procedures
undertaken in cooperation with MTEWA/MFE, and assessed improvement options.

33.    Only a brief account is given in the final report of the TA's attempt to address the issue of
environmental bonds and environmental performance incentives for introduction in Sri Lanka.
Volume I of the main report (chapter 5.6) talks about "Environmental Performance Bonds and
Other Economic Incentives for Environmental Management."

       3.      Strengthening Sri Lanka's Institutional            Capacity    for   National-Level
               Environmental Planning and Management

34.     Expected. Several activities relating to SEA were anticipated, i.e., reports on the current
state of SEA internationally and on Sri Lanka EIA requirements and practices relevant to SEA.
An assessment of opportunities to reduce EIA costs and raise EIA effectiveness through the use
of SEA in sector or regional planning processes was also expected, as were model terms of
reference (TOR) for a regional SEA, and a concept paper on application of sector environmental
assessment.

35.    A computerized database was to be developed tracking EIAs and containing information
on EIA professionals. Training was to be provided for the ministry, CEA, PAA staff, and others in
the use and maintenance of the database.

36.    Recommendations were to be made for an accreditation process for Sri Lankan
environment professionals and assistance to Sri Lanka Environmental Assessment Association
on communication needs and opportunities, guidelines, and editorial help for presentation of
one or more formal papers for the association on aspects of EIA implementation in Sri Lanka.

37.      A policy-level seminar on the use of EIA and SEA in planning for sustainable
development for the ministry, principal PAAs, and key planning and environmental agency
officials was to be organized and briefing materials developed.

38.    Actual. A report, "Introduction of Strategic Environmental Assessment," was compiled
dealing with the concept and categories of SEA, applications of SEA, and strategic
environmental planning in Sri Lanka. It summarizes SEA-related activities initiated by the TA
and contains sample TOR for an integrated regional environmental assessment, as well as a
concept paper on sector SEA for power development.

39.    A computerized EIA database was developed that revised and updated CEA's existing
EIA database to include an EIA process management and tracking system, and a database of
EIA professionals in Sri Lanka. The database on EIA professionals is in need of update, as are
other databases on maps of protected areas, land use, forest areas, wetlands, archeological
reserves, and industries.

40.     The report "Integrating Environment with Development at Policy Level" returned to the
concept and practice of SEA, and summarized a policy-level workshop and forum for
parliamentarians, organized on the recommendation of the Kandalama Policy Level Workshop
on Integration of Economic Development and Environment. The workshop was in response to
the requests made by several government environmental officials during and after the inception
meeting. The workshop created a better understanding and appreciation among senior officials
of the need to support environmental planning, evaluation, and management initiatives.

41.    The TA gave support to the development of the Sri Lanka Environmental Assessment
Association through participation in the association's first annual convention (August 1998),
sharing the database of environment professionals for information and membership resource
and payment of the first year's membership fee to the International Association of Impact
Assessment ($100 per year).

       4.     Improved EIA Capacity at Subnational Levels of Government

42.    Planned. An assessment was to be made of the responsibilities of central, regional, and
provincial authorities in environmental management for review and discussion by selected
national and provincial officials, private sector, and NGO representatives. The workshop would
discuss the assessment and serve as a basis for a report to the ministry with recommendations
on ongoing coordination and training at multiple administrative levels. A report on strengthening
EIA capabilities at selected regional and/or provincial levels for environmental planning was to
be produced.

43.     Actual. The report "Improving Environmental Management at Provincial Level" was
completed in October 1998, summarizing the outcomes and recommendations of two
workshops organized to improve the environmental management and EIA capability in the
provinces. The first workshop was held in April 1998 in Marawila, North Western Province, to
disseminate the experience of environmental management in the province to other provincial
governments. A Model Provincial Council Statute on Environment outlining the powers,
functions, and duties of a provincial environmental agency was presented. The participants
were the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government and selected provinces (Central
Province, North, North­Central, North­West, Sabaragamuwa, South, West, and Uva).

44.    The second workshop on strengthening EIA at universities was held on 31 July­
1 August 1998 in Wadduwa to update environment professionals in the university system on
recent developments in the EIA process in Sri Lanka and on steps necessary to further
strengthen the EIA capacities at the universities.
82     Appendix 5



45.     Additional activities requested by MFE (para. 21) were implemented. They included
intensive training and management guidance for 10 environmental associates recruited by the
MFE who were then placed in selected PAAs; and a workshop for senior ministerial staff and
other policy officials on integrating environmental analysis with economic development.

46.      Policy framework. Sri Lanka's environment and challenges to its protection have been
extensively studied over the years, most recently by the European Union (country environmental
profile, 2005) and the World Bank (EIA system review, 2009). A national environmental action
plan exists along with its partial updates, and national assessments and/or action plans have
been prepared under the main international environmental conventions. Sustainable
development and protection of the environment continue to occupy a prominent place in
government's official position on the country's development path.

47.      The TA was formulated soon after the issuance of Order 859/14 of 1995, which created a
system of environmental oversight based on shared efforts of CEA and PAAs. CEA itself was
established in 1981 based on the National Environmental Act of 1980. The Act's 1988
amendment transformed CEA to an enforcement and implementing agency. EIA and an
environmental protection license (EPL) are the principal tools called upon to safeguard
environmental integrity. EIA is mandated only for prescribed projects specified in a gazette
notification, and initial environmental examination (IEE) for other types of projects. CEA issues
EPLs to medium- and high-polluting industries under section 23(A) of the National Environmental
Act. Since 1994, issuing of EPLs to low-polluting industries has been delegated to local
authorities. A total of 24 state agencies (including, beside the principal ministries and CEA itself,
the Department of Wildlife Conservation, Urban Development Authority, Geological Survey and
Mines Bureau, Ceylon Tourist Board, Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka, Board of Investment, and
Forest Department) have been designed as PAAs for the administration of the EIA process with
CEA bearing the primary responsibility. Public participation in the EIA process is mandatory, and
all EIA reports are open for public comments for a period of 30 working days. Public hearings may
be held at the discretion of the PAA.

48.     Despite some shortcomings, the EIA process is not without teeth, as several high-
publicity court cases demonstrated. Caught between the need to defend itself against charges
of slowing down the pace of economic development and its environment protection mandate,
CEA nonetheless noted that only 4% of 265 EIAs and IEEs submitted between 1993 and 2002
were rejected, and most rejections had reasons other than environmental noncompliance.

49.      As to decentralization of the EIA process to provincial councils, the lack of progress
(under the TA) needs to be seen in a broader context of decentralization in Sri Lanka. It started
in earnest in 1987 with the 13th amendment of Sri Lankan Constitution that devolved power
through to provincial councils, but failed to provide substantial local governance capacity and
fiscal authority. Decentralization of environmental safeguards faces a number of obstacles, and
it is doubtful that progress on EIA decentralization can be made without further and more wide-
ranging reforms of the system. It is possible to argue also that lessening or removal of obvious
weaknesses of the current system is equally important at this stage as the decentralization of
the process to the provinces.

D.     Performance Assessment

50.    Overall assessment. The EIA TA was a major addition to what was a golden decade in
Sri Lanka's environmental management, at least in terms of institutional support by the country's
development partners. The TA was a comprehensive and conscientiously executed initiative
                                                                                                 Appendix 5         83


that addressed many aspects--perhaps too many--of environmental safeguard mechanisms in
place or contemplated. It generated a large number of recommendations and conducted training
that benefited a diverse and suitably chosen audience.

51.    The TA's longer-term results have fallen short of original expectations. Twelve years
after TA completion, the problems of poor EIA quality and the model of environmental
assessment in use since 1995 shows its limitations. The EIA decentralization objectives of the
government, supported by the TA, have not been achieved, and the advances on SEA made
under the TA were soon forgotten, before being partly resuscitated almost a decade later.

52.    The TA is rated partly relevant, less effective, efficient, and less likely sustainable.
Overall, the TA is rated partly successful.

53.    Relevance. The EIA TA was a worthy follow-up on USAID's Natural Resources Project,
the foundation initiative in Sri Lanka post-1990 environmental management. It was based on
adequate discussion with principal development partners and had full support of the
government. The TA had a solid core in its attention to the environmental screening
mechanisms in place. The inclusion of components dealing with EIA decentralization and SEA
seemed well justified at the time even if, in the end, the TA's efforts in those two domains
proved relatively unproductive. A key weakness in the methodology was to have not piloted the
EIA reform with a select group of PAAs and provincial authorities, which resulted in
fragmentation of effort and ineffective long-term engagement from the agencies and
coordination within. On balance, the TA is rated partly relevant.

54.    Effectiveness. The TA is rated less effective. It spread itself too thin and failed to
generate enough outputs. Through well-conceived and well-prepared workshops and training
events, the TA brought its technical messages to a large audience. Given the turnover of staff in
government agencies, few of the original trainees and participants are still involved in
environmental management (most of them in a small number of PAAs such as the Urban
Development Authority, Board of Investment, and Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka) but, as a
minimum, the TA boosted the environmental knowledge of relevant staff at that time.

55.     In retrospect, the TA's work on SEA may have come too early and been carried out
against the background of a number of unresolved issues that hindered SEA's actual use, the
question of interagency collaboration and data-sharing being the most relevant here. CEA
embraced the idea, and some of the SEA outputs produced by the TA have made their way into
CEA's 2007 Simple Guide to Strategic Environmental Assessment. A cabinet resolution was
adopted in 2007 in favor of subjecting all new policies, plans, and programs to SEA in the future,
but this is yet to be sanctioned.

56.    The efforts to develop the capacity of provincial councils and regional bodies to
undertake environmental assessments and play a bigger role in environmental management
was thwarted by a general lack of progress on decentralization in the 1990s.2

57.   Efficiency. The TA is rated efficient. The TA was a busy one, based on a particularly
good plan of activities and characterized by a smooth and constructive relationship of the

2
    Noteworthy that CEA has delegated the task of administering IEE for small and medium-scale projects to its
    provincial offices with the participation of the provincial and local authorities. CEA does agree that training and
    strengthening of its provincial offices is required in order to perform the task better (Source: email of Ms. Ramani
    Ellepola, Director General, CEA, 24 November 2010).
84        Appendix 5



consultant team with the government. Along with a confident and competent TA team
leadership, the TA was implemented efficiently within the budget and (almost) on time.

58.    Sustainability. Mounting calls for a review and further modifications of Sri Lanka's
environmental safeguard systems suggest that the direction taken during the 1990s, of which
the EIA TA was an important part, was not fully sustainable. In retrospect, the challenge has
proved to lie less in supplying the technical basis of the EIA process and more in addressing its
governance aspects (professionalization of the EIA discipline, removing the conflicts of interest
inherent in PAAs potentially acting as project proponents, or disincentive to monitor and
enforce). The TA was aware of some of the governance challenges of the existing approach
and sought to address them (e.g., the question of EIA professionalization) but proved unable to
bring about significant changes during the TA span or thereafter.

59.     CEA, the TA's main client, needs more assistance to face the growing and often conflicting
demands placed on it. And like the majority of government institutions, CEA and PAAs are not
immune to attrition of qualified staff. For all these reasons, sustainability of the direction of the EIA
TA is considered less likely sustainable.

E.        Other Assessments

60.     Impact. Twelve years after the TA's completion, its impact is moderate. It did not
become a transformational initiative that would fundamentally change the way environmental
safeguards are organized and performed, even if it can be credited with incremental
improvements, especially better understanding of various reform options and better grasp of
technical demands placed on EIAs and other types of environmental assessments. The TA is an
example of a well-structured and well-implemented initiative that has not succeeded in changing
for the better environmental governance, both on the CEA/PAA and decentralization side.

61.    However, the TA, reinforced by other environment-related assistance, most notably the
Protected Area Management and Wildlife Conservation Project,3 has added substantially to
ADB's credibility in environmental matters in Sri Lanka. This provides a solid basis for future
collaboration between ADB and the government.

62.      ADB performance. ADB correctly diagnosed the need to improve environmental
safeguards in Sri Lanka and formulated the TA with due recognition and understanding of the
activities of development partners and preferences of the government. It underestimated some
governance issues (conflicts of interest, credibility of EIA reports, etc.), which were obscured by
the many detailed activities of the TA and became apparent only much later. ADB rightly
observed that project-by-project EIAs are insufficient to consider adequately cumulative impacts
of multiple projects in the same region, which is relatively common in Sri Lanka. Tools such as
SEAs are needed, and development of local capacity to undertake SEAs was an important
component of the TA. ADB was less prescient in realizing the magnitude of obstacles for SEAs
in Sri Lanka, in particular, the absence of data-sharing protocols. As a result, the SEA expertise
ran ahead of field realities, which reduced the effectiveness of the component. Overall
performance is rated satisfactory.

63.    Executing agency performance. The executing agency cooperated fully and
constructively with ADB and the TA consultants. Its performance is rated satisfactory.

F.     Issues, Lessons, and Follow-Up Actions

64.      Issues. More than a decade after adopting a model of environmental assessment of
projects that in principle distributes the workload between the official regulator, CEA, and other
qualified government agencies (PAAs), it is time to question the governance soundness of the
model. This is because the list of PAAs includes production- or output-oriented government
ministries (the Board of Investments and Ministry of Highways are two striking examples). While
most senior government officials are aware of the potential conflict of interest (e.g., when the
Road Development Authority reviews EIAs of road rehabilitation projects), the mechanism in
place to avoid it is weak, as it rests mainly on CEA's judgment of the suitability of a PAA to deal
with a given EIA. Conflict of interest is usually avoided but there is no guarantee that it always
will be. The weakness extends to the EIA units within PAAs, supposedly strengthened under the
TA, which in some cases (road authority, for instance) have gone beyond administering the EIA
process to actually conducting the EIA, because they find that doing so is faster and cheaper
than administering the work carried out by outside EIA contractors. Where this is so, the conflict
of interest is real.

65.     Also, more than a decade after the TA's (and EA1P's) efforts to professionalize the
environmental assessment profession and introduce a system of certification and registration,
there is still no system of certification of EIA practitioners in place in Sri Lanka. Even if past
experience and third-party recommendations often inform the authorities and project proponents
who the reliable and competent EIA contractors are (and CEA has a list of EIA practitioners),
such unregulated practice represents an omission in the country's regulatory landscape.

66.      The consequences of uncertain and unverified qualifications and probity of EIA
practitioners are far-reaching and go to the heart of a slow and inefficient EIA process. Lack of
professionally accredited EIA profession adds to the tendency of the PAAs' technical evaluation
committees to formulate needlessly complex and unfocused TORs for environmental
assessments.

67.    EIAs are only as good as the data that underlies their analyses and predictions. It is a
worrisome fact that while laudable efforts are being made to make EIAs available (and the EIA
TA added to these efforts), no obligation exists in Sri Lanka for EIA authors to make available
(not even to CEA) the primary data on which EIA impacts are estimated. Such data is not
attached to EIA documents. This results in a vast duplication of work (for each EIA assessment
data is collected again), needlessly high cost, slow processing of EIA documentation, and a
general absence of reliable baselines to assist monitoring. Also, SEAs cannot be effectively
undertaken if major obstacles to exchange of data exist. It is all part of a much bigger lack of
data sharing between government agencies, and government and nongovernment sectors.

68.    Lessons. Although concerns about insufficiently developed EIA procedures and skills
are understandable, the fundamental problems of environmental governance must not be
overlooked. The TA was aware of these, but let them slip out of focus in the pursuit of other
items on the TA's busy agenda.

69.    EIAs and procedural compliance will not lead to better environmental outcomes without
simultaneous attention to the monitoring of compliance. The latter tends to be more demanding
86     Appendix 5



in environmental capacity-development projects, and tends to come as an afterthought. In Sri
Lanka, any monitoring is made difficult by lack of quality baseline information.

70.     Recommendations. ADB should continue to coordinate with the World Bank and other
interested development partners its future support for further reform of the environmental
safeguard process in Sri Lanka, largely based on the recommendations of the World Bank's
recent review of the EIA system. Among the various dimensions of such reform, ADB may want
to single out the question of environment-related (aim higher if resources allow it) data for
special attention. This should involve categorization of data that should be made public and be
subject to partly restricted and restricted use within the government, and an obligation placed on
EIA reports to contain the primary data used by EIA authors (whether assembled by them or
obtained from other, duly acknowledged, sources).

71.     If SEAs are to be more widely used (as recommended by the EIA TA and the majority of
ADB-supported environmental TA projects), the question of their financing cannot be avoided. In
view of their relative novelty until now, SEAs have invariably been financed by donors on a grant
basis. This situation is not sustainable, especially among the relatively better-off countries such
as Sri Lanka. Because of their typically cross-sector or multi-activity nature that benefits a
number of agencies, their cost would, in principle, deserve to be shared. The sharing formula
needs attention and ADB would do well to consider this topic in its future environment-related
assistance.

       CAPACITY BUILDING OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIVISION OF THE 

                   ROAD DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ­ SRI LANKA 


A.        Summary

1.     The objective of the technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building of the Environmental
and Social Division of the Road Development Authority (RDA) was to strengthen the capacity of
Sri Lanka's RDA to provide adequate environmental and social safeguards for a large portfolio
of road projects, supported by the country's development partners and led by the Asian
Development Bank (ADB).1 While supporting ADB's corporate imperatives, the improvements
achieved under the TA served the wider interest of the government, the development
community, and the public.

2.        The TA was prepared and approved jointly with ADB's National Highways Sector Project in
2005.2 It had technical components aimed at (i) developing RDA's environmental, social, and land
acquisition and resettlement (LAR) safeguards; and (ii) establishing a management information
system (MIS) and an institutionalization component under which an Environmental Social Division
(ESD) was to be created within RDA to become the center of RDA's safeguard activities. In
institutionalizing the ESD, ADB sought to encourage a transition from project-specific safeguards to
regular government budget support for essential activities of a key ADB partner agency.

3.      The TA produced most of the planned outputs, including an environmental safeguards
compliance (ESC) manual and a social assessment and involuntary resettlement compliance
(SAIRC) manual. The manuals were applied to existing projects of RDA and underpinned on-
the-job training of RDA staff. Formats, checklists, and terms of reference (TOR) of a variety of
safeguard documents were developed and internalized. An MIS to systematically monitor the
progress of LAR was developed and made operational. The consultants devised the
organizational structure of RDA's ESD; determined its staff requirements; and provided training
to staff through workshops, field visits, and on the job. ESD was established and became
functional before the TA's completion.

4.       TA formulation was closely linked to the sector investment program of the government
supported by ADB and other development partners. It was well coordinated with the partners'
activities and correctly anticipated the growing importance of tightened safeguards in the years
to come. It was certainly relevant.

5.     The TA outputs were of good quality, grounded in field realities, and have proved useful
during the implementation period so far. The TA was effective. TA completion was delayed on
administrative account on the government's side and by incapacity of one international
consultant. This made the TA less efficient. Given the scale of anticipated road building and
road rehabilitation in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the civil conflict, and the early experience of
post-TA activities of ESD, the direction of the TA is likely sustainable.

6.     In formulating the TA, ADB learned from the experience of earlier activities in the sector
and set the right priorities.3 It adopted a relatively flexible approach to consultant engagement but
could not escape a tendency to formulate overly cautious (and thus excessive) TORs. It never

used the opportunity presented by the TA to question the potential conflict of interest inherent in
asking a project proponent (RDA in this case) to conduct environmental and social assessments.

7.        Despite these reservations, the TA is rated successful overall.

B.        Introduction

8.      Evaluation purpose and process. The TA was completed only a year ago, but even at
this early stage valuable lessons emerge from its implementation.

9.      The evaluation took place in the field during 28 June­2 July 2010 after a detailed desk
review of documentation. The evaluation team interviewed the current staff of the TA executing
agency (RDA) and its ESD created under the TA, and the original TA consultant team leader.
The TA experience was discussed with development partners in Sri Lanka (the United Nations
Development Programme and the World Bank) and the Sri Lanka Resident Mission. The TA
team brought to the evaluation the findings of a related TA (Institutional Strengthening for
Environmental Impact Assessment). The team had full access to TA-related documentation.
The TA completion report had not been prepared by the time of the evaluation and no prior
rating of the TA exists.

10.     Technical assistance objectives. The TA's objectives were to institutionalize compliance
with environmental and social safeguards in all road and highway development projects within the
Ministry of Highways' RDA, and strengthen RDA in dealing with the environmental, social, and
LAR aspects of highway development. Compliance with donors' (including ADB's) and
government's policies, guidelines, and requirements was the expected outcome.

C.        Design and Implementation

11.     Rationale. ADB's extensive lending and TA for road development in Sri Lanka has
always justified close attention to the questions of environmental and social compliance of road
projects.4 The Southern Transport Development Project (footnote 3) and an element of
controversy that surrounded it, leading to project implementation problems and delays, added to
the importance of reinforcing safeguard mechanisms at RDA.5 That need was echoed by
principal development partners supporting the sector (Japan Bank for International Cooperation
and the World Bank) that looked to ADB to take a lead in road sector institutional strengthening.
The formulation of the National Highways Sector Project (footnote 2) provided a good

opportunity to put this intention into practice. The TA was associated to this project and
approved simultaneously with it to build the capacity of ESD.

12.    Formulation. The TA's capacity development was to be directed toward incorporating
environmental and social dimensions in highway development, complying with relevant policies
and requirements of ADB and the government, preparing required safeguard documents,
supervising and monitoring safeguard measures during project implementation, and developing
an MIS to monitor the progress of LAR activities. The TA was to comprise four technical
components, i.e., environmental, social, LAR, and MIS and institutionalization activities.

13.     Cost, financing, and executing arrangements. The total TA cost was estimated at
$500,000 equivalent, comprising $300,000 in foreign exchange and $200,000 in local currency.
It was to be financed by a grant of $400,000 from ADB's TA program, and by the government, in
kind, in the amount of $100,000 equivalent.

14.     The RDA was appointed the TA's executing agency. Two committees were to be
created, i.e., (i) environmental steering committee, chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of
Highways and comprising representatives of RDA, Central Environmental Authority (CEA),
Wildlife Conservation Department, Bureau of Mining, and Coastal Management Department,
would oversee the implementation of the environmental component; and (ii) LAR steering
committee, also chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Highways and consisting of
representatives of the Ministry of Home Affairs, provincial councils and local governments,
Ministry of Land, CEA, RDA, Survey Department, Government Printer, Valuation Department,
and Attorney General's Department to oversee the implementation of the LAR component.

15.     A central support service office was to be established (as part of the National Highway
Project's reform agenda) consisting of the procurement and contract division and ESD, to which
the TA's capacity-development efforts were to be directed.

16.   Consultants and scheduling. A team of consultants--one international and one
domestic environmental specialist, one international and one domestic resettlement specialist,
and one domestic MIS specialist--were to be recruited on an individual basis for 16 person-
months of international and 24 person-months of domestic consulting services.

17.     The TA was to be implemented in 18 months, each consultant serving 8 person-months
intermittently. In the event, some disruption occurred when an international consultant fell ill.
Three extensions were granted, the causes including, besides the consultant's illness, delays in
the printing of several manuals produced by the consultant team. The total actual person-
months used was much lower than the planned estimate. The executing agency wanted the
ESD staff to be involved directly and get trained, which led to reducing local consultant inputs. In
the end, the TA was completed more than 2 years late.

18.      Design changes. No changes were made to the TA design after its approval, but some
activities included in the consultant TOR did not eventuate as they were deemed inapplicable at
the time of project implementation.

19.   Outputs. Below, the TA's planned outputs are compared with the actual outputs,
component by component. Original components 2 and 3 were combined into a single component.

       1.      Component 1: Environmental Component

20.   Planned. The outputs were to include (i) an ESC manual based on a review of current
government environment policy, legislation, and associated regulations and policies of donors,
90        Appendix 6



including ADB's Environment Policy. The manual was to be applied to the National Highways
Project to guide and train ESD staff in ensuring that the project complied with environmental
policies and requirements of the government and ADB; (ii) a set of recommended contents of
environmental safeguard documents, including an environmental screening checklist, TOR of
initial environmental examination (IEE) or environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies, and
summary IEE and EIA documents; (iii) formulation of an environmental emergency program;
(iv) assistance to RDA in implementing a public disclosure policy for the National Highways
Project; (v) assistance to RDA in adopting and implementing the Puttalam­Anuradhapura
subproject as a model of community-based organizations' and local communities' involvement in
monitoring implementation and updating, as necessary, the relevant environmental monitoring
plan through consultations with affected people; (vi) semi-annual reports on implementing the
plan; and (vii) recommendations for further improvement of ESC manual.

21.    Actual. The ESC manual was produced and reviewed by the environmental steering
committee, approved by RDA's Board of Directors, and applied not only to the National
Highways Project but also to the Road Project TA Loan (footnote 4) as well. The environment
screening checklist was compiled and incorporated in the ESC manual, as were TORs of IEE
and summary IEE documents.6 A total of 13 draft IEEs were reviewed and submitted to CEA
and ADB. No output was delivered under items 3 to 7.7

          2.        Component 2: Social and Resettlement Component

22.     Planned. The outputs were (i) an operations manual for social and resettlement impacts
with due consideration of poverty, gender, stakeholder participation, resettlement, affordability,
labor, and indigenous peoples issues based on a review of existing relevant government and
ADB policies, regulations, and requirements; (ii) development of formats and checklists for
monitoring involuntary resettlement; (iii) guidance to social and resettlement staff of ESD on the
application of the operations manual to the National Highways Project; and (iv) assistance to
RDA in implementing the public disclosure policy for the National Highways Project.

23.       Actual. An integrated SAIRC manual was produced, reviewed by RDA and the LAR
steering committee, and approved by RDA's Board of Directors. The manual included (i) a
section on initial social assessment and social safeguards screening and categorization; and
(ii) introduction and guide to initial poverty and social assessment preparation that addresses
poverty analysis, description of participation process, gender analysis and strategy, and
assessment of social safeguard issues; and (iii) format of the screening form for involuntary
resettlement. Training in the use of the SAIRC manual was provided to new staff of ESD.
Guidance was provided to ESD in the preparation of the initial poverty and social assessment
for submission to ADB and posting on its website.

          3.        Component 3: Management Information System

24.    Planned. An MIS to systematically monitor the progress of LAR was to be developed
that would include (i) detailed information for each group of affected people with regard to type
and extent of loss, valuation, entitlements, payments, relocation, etc.; (ii) monthly, quarterly, and
annual monitoring reports; and (iii) monthly social/LAR audit reports.



6
    No EIA or summary EIA format was included as all subproject studied under the National Highways Project were of
    category B, i.e., not requiring EIA.
7
    The activities associated with construction monitoring were slated to begin with the start of construction activities.
    Semi-annual reports on environmental monitoring are now being produced with a dedicated official from ESD.
                                                                                                  Appendix 6         91


25.     Actual. The MIS was developed and tested, and ESD staff trained in its use. The
system contains a database on safeguards-compliance-related aspects of road sector
development. The MIS set up with TA funding has been effectively used in locating
environmental and natural resources that need to be safeguarded when considering road
development in an area. However, more work is required to fully digitize all the necessary land
acquisition data.

         4.       Other (Cross-Component) Outputs

26.      Planned. The safeguard compliance review procedures were to be developed and
institutionalization of the safeguards ensured.

27.     Actual. The safeguards compliance review procedures were duly developed. The ESC
manual includes "ESC processes and procedures" (a step-by-step summary), and the SAIRC
manual includes "RDA: Summary of Processes on Land Acquisition and Involuntary
Resettlement." The consultants developed an organizational structure of the ESD, determined
staff requirement, and provided training to staff through workshops, field visits, and on the job.
ESD was created.8 Seven seminars on various aspects of ESC were organized for RDA staff.
Two resettlement planning workshops (December 2006 and March 2007); an intensive EIA
training program (5­14 January 2007); and English-language, MIS database management, and
computer skills trainings were also implemented.

28.    Varied support was given to ADB-funded Road Sector Project and TA loan on Road
Project (footnote 4) and National Highways Project (footnote 2) to ensure that safeguards
compliance was achieved.

29.     Policy framework. The TA can be seen both as an element in Sri Lanka's development
partners' efforts to ensure that their investments are beyond environmental and social reproach
and as part of a wider (and older) search for better environmental and social governance in Sri
Lanka. As to the former, the project was a close expression of ADB's (pre-2009)9 safeguard
policies on the environment and involuntary resettlement10 that reinforce and continue to apply
to all ADB assistance. In the latter case, the TA is best seen as a concentrated application of
existing government safeguards to a specific sector. The policy, anchored in the National
Environmental Act, places CEA at the heart of the environmental safeguards process in Sri
Lanka and makes EIA and the environmental protection license the principal tools of
environmental and social compliance of "prescribed" projects.11 The system provides for a
possible delegation of environmental assessment to one of 24 project-approving agencies
(PAAs) while reserving the ultimate decision on environmental acceptability for CEA. The
Ministry of Highways, through RDA, is one of the PAAs. Public participation in the EIA process
is mandatory, and all EIA reports are open for public comments for a period of 30 working days.
Public hearings may be held at the discretion of the PAA.

30.    The current approach to involuntary resettlement in Sri Lanka is based on the National
Involuntary Resettlement Policy of 2001, which provides for full and prompt compensation of
those adversely affected, resettlement assistance, information of the process of grievance

   As were RDA's LAR committees at the division level.
9
   The TA predated ADB Board's approval of the new Safeguard Policy Statement in 2009.
10
   Indigenous people safeguards, component of the overall ADB safeguard structure, are less relevant to Sri Lanka.
11
   Among CEA's tasks is also to determine that the project developers in every project-related activity, e.g.,
   construction, land acquisition, relocation or resettlement, etc., comply with and act in accordance with the country's
   laws, ordinances, and regulations.
92         Appendix 6



redress,12 and transparency of the resettlement process. The Ministry of Land and Land
Development approves resettlement implementation plans. The approach to land acquisition is
based on the Land Acquisition Act of 1950, amended in 1986. In general, the process of land
acquisition has been marked by its slowness, in part caused by lack of reconciliation between
the Land Acquisition Act and the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy, delays in land
surveys by the Survey Department, bureaucratic delays in land valuation, unclear deeds, etc. In
the aftermath of the civil war and the large-scale resettlement that this entailed, both land
acquisition and involuntary resettlement have acquired an additional degree of sensitivity.

D.         Performance Assessment

31.      Overall assessment. The TA was a high-priority initiative designed rapidly to improve
the environmental and social safeguard capacity of a key ADB partner agency in Sri Lanka. It
has substantially achieved that objective. The RDA's ESD, created under the TA, can now
confidently administer the process of environmental and social assessment of road projects.
The TA has helped overcome some of the procedural weaknesses of earlier projects in the
sector and in the process enhanced the credibility of RDA and ADB. The TA is rated successful
overall.

32.     Relevance. The TA was relevant. Land acquisition, involuntary resettlement, and
environment-related concerns have always been important dimensions of road projects in Sri
Lanka, even if practice lagged behind policies and their intentions. Some of the limitations of
existing procedures surfaced in earlier donor assistance to the sector. In view of that, the TA
was an appropriate and much-needed response, fully supported by the government not only
because of the pressure of its development partners but also for domestic reasons.

33.      Effectiveness. The TA largely delivered the anticipated outputs. These were of good
quality, grounded in field realities, accompanied by hands-on training and almost immediately
applied to existing RDA-implemented projects. The improvements have been institutionalized: a
separate division (ESD) of RDA was created, suitably staffed and with a career path offered to
its officers. A monitoring information system was put in place and is now used, even if not to its
full potential. The TA was effective.

34.    Efficiency. A relatively small and nimble team of international and domestic consultants
implemented the TA. Some problems arose caused by illness in the consultant ranks, and
unnecessary delays occurred at the very end of the original implementation period caused by
administrative slowness that kept delaying finalization of some of the TA's written outputs. While
the substantive work of the TA was completed with only a small delay, the formal completion
was achieved more than 2 years late. Taken together, the TA was less efficient.

35.     Sustainability. Likely sustainable. After the end of civil war in Sri Lanka in 2009, the
infrastructure rehabilitation tasks ahead of the government are considerable. The flurry of donor-
supported activities (in which the TA was a major element) aimed at strengthening
environmental and social safeguards in the road sector has resulted in significant improvements
of technical knowledge, procedures, and practices inside RDA that appear sustainable in the
longer run. International exposure for ESD staff through workshops and training on international
12
     The government established mediation boards (samatha mandala) to bring the disputants to an amicable
     settlement. Mediation boards are set up in every divisional secretariat, and disputes relating to movable and
     immovable property, contracts, use of criminal force, grievous harm, intimidation, criminal trespass, defamation,
     and breach of peace between private parties can be mediated. In 2003, the government also established special
     mediation boards to provide for resolution of disputes related to social and economic issues. The minister of justice
     determines the category of such disputes. While the mediation boards deal only with disputes between private
     parties, the special mediation boards allow for the state or a public officer to be a disputant party.
                                                                              Appendix 6      93


good practice environmental and social safeguards at bilateral and multilateral fora will assist
with sustaining the outcomes of the TA.

E.     Other Assessments

36.     Impact. The TA, along with other related actions taken by ADB and the government
(implementation of the Southern Transport TA, a thorough review of LAR compliance
arrangements, etc.), made genuine advances in the approaches to and mechanisms of dealing
with otherwise thorny issues of land acquisition and involuntary settlement in Sri Lanka. Vastly
better conditions exist for undertaking further projects in the sector. The TA was significant.

37.     ADB performance. ADB acted decisively on issues of compensation surrounding the
Southern Transport Development Project, which were regarded as a vital precondition of social
and economic rehabilitation in Sri Lanka. ADB closely and effectively cooperated with RDA in
designing and implementing the TA and nurturing the ESD. Although ADB could have paid
greater attention to broader governance issues, in particular to the CEA­PAA model of
environmental oversight that can result in a project proponent (such as RDA) not only
administering the EIA process but actually undertaking the environmental and social assessment.
Wide use of this approach in Sri Lanka and elsewhere does not necessarily remove its potential
for creating a conflict of interest. Overall ADB performance is rated satisfactory.

38.     Executing agency performance. RDA was an excellent host and executing agency,
fully supportive of the TA. Performance rated satisfactory.

F.     Issues, Lessons, and Follow-Up Actions

39.      Issues. An evaluation of the EIA TA undertaken as part of this TA performance
evaluation report raises several issues of environmental governance. It notes that the list of
PAAs (for the purposes of environmental clearance) includes production- or output-oriented
government ministries (e.g., the Board of Investments, to take a striking example, but also
Ministry of Highways). While most senior government officials are aware of the potential
conflicts of interest (e.g., when RDA reviews EIAs of road rehabilitation projects), the
mechanism in place to avoid it is weak, resting largely on CEA's judgment of the suitability of a
PAA to deal with a given EIA. Conflict of interest is usually avoided but there is no guarantee
that it always will be. That weakness extends further: the EIA cells or units within PAAs,
established or strengthened under TA, have in some cases gone beyond administering the EIA
process to actually conduct the EIA because they find that doing so is faster and cheaper than
administering the work carried out by outside EIA contractors; including in the case of ESD, as
the independent evaluation mission learned. Where this happens, the conflict of interest is real.
It also raises fundamental questions about the very direction of policies that see answers to
insufficient environmental compliance in the creation or strengthening of "environmental cells"
and the like inside project-proposing government agencies.

40.    Lessons. There is nothing like a sense of urgency to encourage formulation of focused
TA projects that enjoy full and undivided support of those whose reputation is at stake.

41.      Recommendations. This evaluation has taken place a little too soon after the TA's
official completion. For that reason, ADB should review the performance of ESD about 2 years
from now, paying attention to components such as construction-stage environmental monitoring,
LAR, etc., that are known to be a good indirect indicator of the durability of improvements
introduced under a TA. To satisfactorily meet its mandate for environmental safeguards
protection, ESD may require financial assistance to supplement its repository of environmental
94         Appendix 6



monitoring and technical equipment, viz., computer accessories (plotter and high speed
dedicated computer for geographic information system mapping), noise level meter (with
recording capability), dust meter (with ability to measure PM1013 with other parameters).

     Particulates, alternatively known to as particulate matter (PM) or fine particles and also called soot, are tiny
     subdivisions of solid matter suspended in a gas or liquid. The notation PM10 is used to describe particles of

A.        Urban Transport and Environment Improvement Study (TA 3297-BAN)

2.       Objective and scope. The TA was to assist the government in formulating a strategy to
improve air quality in Dhaka and other major cities in Bangladesh by developing strategies to
ensure that vehicular emissions are reduced over an 8-year project period to levels below those
existing at the time of the TA.1 Specifically, the TA aimed to (i) identify stakeholders and their
role in improving air quality in the major cities, particularly Dhaka; (ii) develop an action plan to
control and phase out dirty fuel in the transport sector; (iii) develop an action plan for the
introduction of clean fuel based on natural gas for both public and private transportation modes,
including supply and delivery links; (iv) review environmental rules and regulations related to
vehicular emissions and recommending implementation strategies; (v) develop an action plan to
improve the operation and maintenance (O&M) standards of registered vehicles, initially in
Dhaka; and (vi) identify the potential role of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the
implementation of the action plan from the perspective of subsequently formulating a policy-
oriented urban transport pollution project.

3.      Key outputs. The TA was able to study, in particular, several components to improve
the air quality management system: (i) air quality assessment, (ii) environmental damage
assessment, (iii) assessment of abatement options, (iv) optimum control strategy, (v) cost­
benefit analysis or cost­effectiveness analysis, and (vi) abatement measures. It also identified
the sources of air pollution, particularly those related to motor vehicles, and suggested means to
reduce these pollutants through the development of action plans; reviewed relevant regulations
and recommended policy changes; and identified the potential role of ADB in helping improve
the situation. The TA produced an action plan comprising 26 components for urban transport
and environmental improvement.



1
    Details of the TA projects are in Appendix 1. They are not footnoted when they are referred to in the text.
96        Appendix 7



4.        Performance assessment. On the whole, the technical assistance completion report
(TCR) rated the TA successful. This evaluation rates the TA partly relevant (0.2), signifying design
inadequacy that resulted in several changes to the TA team's composition and required additional
person-months to meet the scope. The TA was in accordance with the then and even current ADB
strategies and the government's plans and efforts to focus on environmental sustainability,
particularly in urban infrastructure development, abating pollution in the transport sector, clean
fuels development, and promoting urban public and environmental health. The outcomes as
envisaged at appraisal were substantially achieved; hence, the TA is rated effective (0.6). It was
able to assist the Government of Bangladesh in carrying out more effectively a strategy to improve
air quality in major cities throughout the country, and to provide a well-coordinated program that
considers simultaneous development, implementation, and enforcement of the policies in the
energy, transport, and environment sectors. The project completion report and the Independent
Evaluation Department's validation report for Southwest Road Network Development Project state
that its institutional and governance components, although late in realization, were accomplished.2
However, this review rates the TA less efficient (0.3); although it was able to produce all required
outputs as intended (including most of the outputs added to its original terms of reference) and
within the cost limit, it was not able to do this within its original timeframe, resulting in an extension
of the completion date of 9 months. The TA is rated less likely (0.2) sustainable; there appears to
be a shortage of funds for maintenance and upgrading of roads, and poorly maintained and
serviced roads will result in poor air quality. For the road projects, there is also concern that
overloaded trucks will accelerate road deterioration; and only a small fraction of private vehicles
are operating on compressed natural gas, thus continuing to contribute to poor air quality.

5.        Overall assessment. The TA is rated partly successful as against the TCR's successful.

B.        Strengthening Environmental Impact Assessment Capabilities and Preparation of
          Environmental Guidelines (TA 2531-BHU)

6.      Objective and scope. The fundamental objective of the TA was to assist the
government in strengthening the environmental impact assessment (EIA) capabilities of the
National Environment Commission (NEC) and in preparing environmental guidelines for
appropriate implementation of the EIA program. The TA scope includes the following: (i) assist
NEC in preparing detailed guidelines for procedures to support the existing umbrella EIA
guidelines; (ii) help finalize the draft initial environmental examination (IEE) guidelines and
prepare the detailed sector-specific EIA guidelines for major development projects, and selected
environmental quality, effluent and emission standards suitable for the country; (iii) conduct
training in EIA for target audiences, i.e., administrators and planners, EIA practitioners, IEE and
EIA reviewers, private sector representatives, and nongovernment organizations; (iv) assess the
options of strengthening planning divisions in priority line ministries as the focal point for
environmental management or establishing environmental units in those ministries; (v) create
mechanisms between NEC and the line ministries to promote coordination in the
implementation of government environmental requirements; and (vi) provide advice in the
government's human resources development (HRD) plan to build an environmental capacity
that meets the needs of the national EIA program.

7.      Key outputs. The TA was able to substantially accomplish all of its envisaged outputs,
including (i) the review of current and planned decrees, laws, policies, and regulations, as well as
existing organizational, institutional, and legal arrangements for environmental assessment;

(ii) drafting of the EIA process, where a detailed procedural guideline was prepared;
(iii) preparation of comprehensive sector-specific EIA guidelines for development of various
projects (highways and roads, mining and mineral processing, hydropower, power transmission
lines, forests) and for new and existing industries; (iv) compilation and preparation of standards for
ambient air quality and industrial air emissions; water quality criteria for drinking, recreation,
aquatic life, agriculture, and industry; and industrial wastewater; (v) development of a standard
operating procedures manual for field sampling and analytical methods; (vi) conduct of trainings
and workshops on strengthening EIA capabilities at NEC and selected ministries; and
(vii) preparation of short- and medium-term HRD programs for NEC, line ministries, private sector,
colleges, and research organizations for EIA implementation. Also, the TA was able to deliver
additional outputs to those envisaged during formulation. These were assistance to the legal
consultant of the Danish International Development Assistance (Danida) in the preparation of the
draft Environmental Assessment Act, which was based on the TA's outputs; preparation of
guidelines for strategic environmental assessment; and initial work on the collection of baseline
water quality data from several rivers.

8.      Performance assessment. The TA is rated relevant (0.4). It has been included in ADB's
1995 country operational program for Bhutan,3 and its theme remains key to ADB's sector-
specific interventions for Bhutan, as cited in the country strategy and program (CSP) for Bhutan
(2006­2010).4 The TA laid a solid foundation for the advancement of environmental
management in Bhutan, successfully assisting NEC in strengthening EIA capabilities, rating it
effective (0.6). Although ADB was not directly involved in the drafting of subsequent EIA
regulations, it cannot be discounted that these have benefited from experience gained under the
TA. Among the policies adopted after TA completion were (i) Bhutan's long-term development
plan, "Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness (1999)," which stresses the
need to institutionalize the capacity to undertake EIAs as a means of achieving environmentally
sustainable development; (ii) Environmental Assessment Act (2000), which legitimizes
environmental assessment procedures; (iii) regulations for environmental clearance of projects;
and (iv) regulations for strategic environmental assessment, both adopted in 2002. Trainings
conducted significantly raised EIA awareness, understanding, and capabilities of participants.
However, contrary to the TCR's highly efficient rating, the TA is rated less efficient (0.3). This
review based its rating on the significant delay in TA completion (from April 1997 to 30 April
1999). Delay in the implementation of the first phase of TA was due to major political changes
within the government in July 1998, which affected NEC's senior officials, and further extension
was sought by the executing agency during the latter part of the TA to allow internal discussion
and to obtain the government's approval that the TA reports be finalized as official documents.
In doing so, the consultant inputs were increased from 22 person-months to 28.2 person-
months, although this did not have a major impact on total TA cost because of the relatively low
rates of consultants. However, it substantially increased the consultants' share of cost including
remuneration, per diem, and travel at the time of TA closing. Having the TA outputs published
and adopted as official documents, the TA is rated likely sustainable (0.4). NEC has been able
to maintain the momentum of the TA's efforts to establish and operate an effective EIA system,
including the enactment of an EIA act and regulations, and successfully fit it into the parallel
environmental strengthening programs carried out by Danida and the United Nations
Development Programme. Also, ADB assistance to Bhutan will continue to complement the core
environmental support of other development partners by mainstreaming sustainable
development initiatives into its public sector operations and by helping the government to
steadily improve the regulatory basis for environmental management.

9.        Overall assessment: The TA is rated successful in agreement with the TCR.

C.        Capacity Building to Implement Environmental Assessment Procedures (TA 4636-
          BHU)

10.      Objective and scope. The TA was to assist the Government of Bhutan with a capacity-
development program to implement its environmental assessment procedures, particularly at
the agencies authorized to issue development consent for a project under Article 6.4 of the
Environmental Assessment Act. The TA scope was to (i) improve the capacity of government
officials at all levels to implement the environmental clearance procedures, (ii) strengthen the
technical capacity of environmental assessment practitioners and proponents of development
projects in the country, and (iii) build up a core group of trainers to conduct in-country training in
environmental assessment.

11.     Key outputs. Five major components of the TA accomplished the following: (i) conducted
a program for training of trainers, including an Overseas Exposure Program by a group of core
environmental assessment trainers of Bhutan in January 2006 on practices in Viet Nam and
Thailand; (ii) prepared training modules: Reference Manual for Environmental Impact Assessment
Training in Bhutan, and Trainers' Guide for EIA Training; (iii) conducted training and/or awareness
programs or workshops, attended by representatives from the private sector (industrial, mining,
and construction), dzongkhag (district) environmental committee members, and high-level
policymakers; and (iv) initialized the institutionalization of training programs through initial
collaboration with Royal Bhutan Institute of Technology in Phuentsholing, where modules
developed under the TA would be used by the institute's curricula.

12.       Performance assessment. The TA is rated partly relevant (0.2), since substantial
increases in international consultant inputs signify a shortcoming in the original design. The
decentralization prompted delegation of responsibilities on environmental assessment
implementation from NEC to agencies that mostly do not have the expertise and manpower to
effectively take on the responsibilities of a competent authority. The TA has been included in
ADB's 2005 CSP update (2005­2006) for Bhutan,5 and its theme remains key to ADB's sector-
specific interventions, as cited in the CSP 2006­2010 (footnote 4). There is not enough
information to say whether this TA has been effective or not. However, the independent evaluation
mission for the Bhutan country assistance program evaluation undertaken in February 2010 met
NEC officials and recommended further strengthening of EIA capabilities, in particular through
competent authorities both at central and provincial level; hence, it is rated less effective (0.3).
Though the TCR has found an increase in effectiveness and efficiency in the implementation of
environmental assessment in Bhutan after less than 3 years of TA implementation (June 2008),
very little information supports a strengthened and effective capability, particularly of all competent
authorities by 2006, as envisaged during TA formulation. However, the TA has documented
heightened awareness and enhanced technical capacity of officials in key sectors (mining and
construction) and at the district level, benefiting a large number of government officials,
practitioners, and project proponents. Final TA documents report that the TA was able to improve
effectiveness and efficiency in the conduct of environmental assessment in Bhutan. The TA is
rated less efficient (0.3), however; while it was able to completely deliver the envisaged outputs
and activities within allocated TA cost, its completion was delayed by about 5 months. The overall
sustainability of the TA, given identified benefits and outcomes, is rated likely (0.4) sustainable.
Several TA outputs have been committed to sustained use by the environmental assessment and

other participating agencies, such as (i) the Royal Bhutan Institute of Technology to use the
modules developed under the TA in its degree and diploma curricula, and (ii) NEC to use
reference documents in conducting future training of a similar nature. Similarly, CSP 2006­2010
continues to complement the government in steadily improving the regulatory basis for
environmental management.

13.       Overall assessment. The TA is rated partly successful as against the TCR's successful.

D.        Promoting Sound Environmental Management in the Aftermath of the Tsunami
          Disaster (TA 4614-MLD)

14.     Objective and scope. The goal of the TA was to develop and test on tsunami-affected
islands an environmental management program that focuses predominantly but not solely on
environmental health and awareness. Specifically, the TA was to promote good governance by
devolving responsibilities to the island communities; reduce poverty through regional human
development; and provide opportunities for cooperative and private sector development, as
highlighted in the CSP 2004­2006 and its update.6 In support of the country's recovery efforts
after the December 2004 tsunami, ADB formulated the Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project
(TEAP), which included assistance to the water supply and sanitation, and solid waste
management sectors. The TEAP, however, concentrated exclusively on providing and
rehabilitating infrastructure, hence, a complementary sound environmental management
program was deemed critical to the long-term sustainability of outputs. In phase I, the TA will
support infrastructure development activities under the TEAP. Phase II on environmental
infrastructure and management made further use of community organization and training and
education materials. The TA was to provide the government with the operating framework
needed to replicate such activities and devolve O&M activities to island communities.

15.     Key outputs. Four major activities were carried out under the TA and have
accomplished the following outputs: (i) in lieu of a rehabilitation and reconstruction strategy for
the water and sanitation sector, where extensive work had already been undertaken by the
water supply and sanitation government (post-tsunami) coordination group, a community-based
water quality monitoring and resource management was alternately developed; (ii) developed,
tested, and promoted innovative environmental education and public awareness, including, but
not limited to (a) a rapid perception assessment into environmental management in selected
communities in the Maldives; (b) adequate methodologies and tools for promoting
environmental education and awareness; and (c) materials for environmental awareness,
education, and outreach program; (iii) reviewed approaches to community organization for
environmental management in the Maldives and outlined a preferred approach through a series
of community mobilization and organization guidelines; and (iv) conducted training of some
20 Ministry of Environment and Construction staff to meet the country's reconstruction needs.

16.    Performance assessment. The TA is rated relevant (0.4). The TA complements TEAP
to the Maldives after the completion of the 2004 CSP update and was part of ADB's efforts to
support the government in reconstruction.7 Capacity development and environmental
sustainability remain two of ADB's priority themes in the country partnership strategy (CPS)
2007­2011.8 The TA has reported some changes in the communities trained, where an increase

in community participation in the delivery of environmental and utility O&M programs in its pilot
project areas were documented. A preliminary assessment during the TA's review mission in
November 2006 indicated achievable impact of the TA in catalyzing institutional change. The
new models, approaches, and techniques that were provided and field-tested were easily
replicable in islands across the Maldives and were expected to contribute to the reversed loss of
environmental resources within the country. However, limited information is available on
whether these have been actually replicated in subsequent projects in the Maldives. The TA is
rated less effective (0.3). The TA is rated efficient (0.6); but if not for the minor delay in project
implementation extending its completion from 31 May 2006 to 31 December 2006, it may be
rated highly efficient, as it was able to deliver significantly longer consultant inputs, from
30 person-months to 44.5 person-months, and still managed to work within the original TA
budget. The TA is rated likely (0.4) sustainable. The tsunami experience has underscored the
urgent need for stronger early warning and disaster-management capacity, particularly on the
more remote and vulnerable atolls. Current CPS-identified strategies and programs for climate
adaptation need to be incorporated in the government's master plan for disaster preparedness
and mitigation. Under the ongoing Regional Development II Project, which assists the provision
of water supply and sanitation on selected islands particularly affected after the December 2004
tsunami, environmentally friendly designs will be pursued.9 Incidentally, the same TA consultant
was engaged for this project, which may suggest continuity of the TA's benefits.

17.      Overall assessment. The TA is rated successful in agreement with the TCR.

E.       Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Population and Environment (TA
         2847-NEP)

18.      Objective and scope. The overall objective of the TA is to strengthen the institutional
capacity of the Ministry of Population and Environment (MOPE) so that it can effectively carry
out its mandate for environmental protection. Specifically, the TA was to develop MOPE's
institutional, operational, and regulatory framework and staff skills; build links with other
government agencies and the non-formal sector to assist MOPE in operationalizing
environmental protection objectives; and develop a capacity for undertaking effective public
awareness programs.

19.  Key outputs. Major outputs and accomplishments under the TA's implementation were
(i) development of the strategic environmental framework for MOPE (Strategic Roles and
Responsibilities of MOPE, 1999­2004); (ii) review of pertinent legislations in the context of
institutional development issues and strategic opportunities and constraints; (iii) development of
an Integrated Environmental Management Program, the Ministry's "flagship" which identified its
oversight and coordinating role and placed operational responsibility with agencies that are best
positioned to implement the Integrated Environmental Management Program (Federation of
Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry [FNCCI], Ministry of Industry, Ministry of
Finance, and other stakeholders); (iv) capacity development of MOPE staff through on-the-job
training, though there was limited success in their involvement; (v) development of an HRD
strategy for the environment sector, and especially MOPE; (vi) review of criteria and preparation
of procedural guidelines for EIA; (vii) implementation of demonstration projects for both air and
water quality monitoring; (viii) organization of a task force comprised of representatives from
Ministry of Industry, Department of Industries, Nepal Bureau of Standards and Metrology,

MOPE, and FNCCI to assist in establishing environmental standards; (ix) development of public
awareness and environmental education strategies, particularly Communication to Save the
Environment and Learning for Life: A National Strategy for Environmental Education in Nepal;
(x) production of several public awareness products; and (xi) initiation and promotion of action
projects, i.e., the Village Development Committee Demonstration Project.

20.       Performance assessment. The TA is rated relevant (0.4). The capacity-development
nature of this TA continues to be a key component in both the Government of Nepal's and
ADB's development strategies even if there have been institutional changes, such as the case
of this TA's executing agency, where the government has dissolved MOPE in 2005 and
attached its Environment Division to a new ministry, Ministry of Environment and Science and
Technology. ADB's CPS 2010­2012 acknowledged Nepal's environmental policies and laws as
fairly comprehensive and sound, but their enforcement and implementation as generally weak.10
There are still ongoing changes within the government's environmental agencies. It has recently
established a separate Ministry of Environment to address the lack of knowledge, resources,
and effective coordination mechanism. The National Planning Commission (NPC) is reactivating
its environment unit. Ministries and departments have started to coordinate for undertaking joint
environmental monitoring of implementation of development projects. The need for
environmental capacity development in the said government sector remains at the top of the
government's and ADB's priorities. The TA is rated less effective (0.3). Even if the TCR and the
executing agency rate the TA successful after adoption of the outputs by the government (the
Strategic Environmental Framework was officially approved on April 1999, while the revised EIA
guidelines were passed by the Nepal Cabinet in February 1999), the outcomes are essentially
just initial steps of a longer process to improve environmental protection at the national level. On
the whole, the TA was able to achieve the envisaged outputs, but was unable to effectively
establish realistic institutional arrangements during its implementation. The TA targeted capacity
development of MOPE, but it was not able to deliver this in an effective way that would lead to
stronger skills development in the ministry appropriate for growing environmental management
problems in Nepal. Nepal is a signatory or party to several environment-related conventions and
is obligated to fulfill its commitments to them at national and global levels. Unfortunately,
procedural delays are common in the ratification of some important international environmental
treaties and conventions, and their obligations are not being fulfilled on time. MOPE (now the
Ministry of Environment, Science, and Technology [MOEST]) has only been able to ratify a few
of them so far. The major reason is the failure of the agencies concerned to understand the
technical aspects of the subject. Other reasons include a lack of initiative and capacity on the
part of the ministry. Also, MOEST lacks appropriate resources to monitor the mitigation of
identified impacts in the EIA of a project. Despite the completeness of the outputs delivered
within the allocated TA cost, the TA may be rated less efficient (0.3) based on delayed TA
completion from 31 January 1999 to 7 December 1999, as well as start-up delays of almost
10 months after TA signing. The TA is rated likely (0.4) sustainable. With the environment
division now moved to MOEST, it has taken over all the environmental functions of MOPE.
Some of the TA outputs' have been adopted by other funding agencies: (i) the Strategic
Environmental Framework for MOPE was approved by the Ministry toward the end of the TA
and had formed part of a major 5-year environmental management program supported by
Danida (2001­2005); (ii) a study was conducted by MOPE on institutional strengthening of the
EIA process for hydropower development in Nepal with the Norwegian Agency for Cooperation
and Development support during 2002­2004; and (iii) ADB's current CPS 2010­2012 (footnote
10) identified two of four pillars in achieving strategic priorities as governance and capacity
development, and climate change adaptation and environmental sustainability to address this

institutional weaknesses in the environmental agencies brought about by the fragile political
situation.

21.     Overall assessment. The TA is rated partly successful as against the TCR's successful.

F.      Institutional Strengthening of NEA's Environmental Division (TA 2613-NEP)

22.     Objective and scope. The TA was primarily intended to build the capacity of the Nepal
Electricity Authority (NEA) for ensuring that environmental and social issues were adequately
addressed in the design, construction, operation, and monitoring of power development
projects.11 The original justification of the TA first came up when NEA asked for a TA from ADB
in strengthening its environmental unit during the time Arun III Hydropower Project was being
developed by the government.12 The request was made in realization that environmental and
social impacts associated with power development in Nepal were becoming major issues and
that NEA should increase its in-house capacity to deal with these issues in preference to a
heavy reliance on foreign expertise. The request resurfaced during the processing of the Kali
Gandaki "A" Hydroelectric Project. Specifically, the TA intended to assess and review the
existing environmental and social management framework in Nepal in the context of NEA
operations; assist NEA to formulate an environmental and social management framework that
includes, inter alia, a 5-year operational program; (iii) provide trainings to all NEA-Environmental
Division (NEA-ED) staff and other selected NEA staff; and (iv) establish an environmental
management information system at NEA and train the staff in its use and maintenance.

23.     Key outputs. The TA was able to generate the following: assessment and
recommendations for revision of environmental and social management frameworks;
recommendations for a revised NEA environmental and social policy and mandate;
environmental and social guidelines for use by NEA-ED staff; recommendations for a
reorganization within NEA-ED that better reflects NEA's needs regarding social and
environmental management of programs and projects; development of an environmental
management information system, in-house training programs, and external trainings for key
staff; acquisition of materials including essential computer equipment; and setting-up of an EIA
reference library. The TA facilitated the translation of Nepal Environmental Protection
Regulations into English, which was beyond the scope of the TA. However, two expected
outputs were not delivered: (i) 5-year operational program, and (ii) detailed EIA procedure
appropriate for NEA.

24.      Performance assessment. The TA is rated relevant (0.4). This supports the objective of
the Kali Gandaki Project (footnote 11), which aimed to meet the demand for electric power in
Nepal at least cost in an environmentally sustainable and socially sustainable manner. An
institutional assessment undertaken during the processing of the Kali Gandaki Project revealed
that NEA, the executing agency, required support for institutional strengthening to better
address environmental and social issues related to hydropower development. Hence, based on
the need to upgrade the capabilities within NEA-ED to complement the benefits that will flow
from implementing the Kali Gandaki environmental monitoring unit, ADB and NEA agreed on
the TA. The need for institutional strengthening of NEA emerged earlier on during the

   Arun III was a hydropower project in Nepal at the Arun River. In this project, 404 megawatts of electricity was
   expected to be produced. However, there was opposition toward development on environmental grounds and the
   scale of the project. In 1995, the World Bank decided to withdraw its support to the project.
                                                                                           Appendix 7        103


processing of the Arun III Hydropower Project (footnote 12). The government made the request
in realization that environmental and social impacts associated with power development in
Nepal were becoming major issues, and that NEA should increase its in-house capacity to deal
with these issues in preference to a heavy reliance on foreign expertise. The TA supports the
government's environmental policy (1993 Nepal Environmental Policy and Action Plan),
particularly in managing efficiently and sustainably natural and physical resources and in
balancing development efforts and environmental conservations for sustainable fulfillment of the
basic needs of the people. The TA is rated less effective (0.3). The two expected outputs not
delivered were 5-year operational program and detailed EIA guidelines and manuals. The
repeated requests made by NEA to ADB for a new and more comprehensive institutional
strengthening package and to use the remaining TA funds to finance trainings can be used as
an indicator of the lack of TA effectiveness in achieving the expected outcomes. Benefits from
trainings could have been improved through better coordination between consultants and NEA,
and a workable training schedule could have been agreed and implemented. The TA outcome
was not adequate to support ADB's operational strategy for Nepal as stated in para. 15 of the
RRP for the Kali Gandaki Project, as it failed to strengthen NEA's institutional capacity for
ensuring the environmental and social issues were adequately addressed in the design,
construction, operation, and monitoring of hydropower development projects. The TA is rated
less efficient (0.3). Available data did not permit a comprehensive estimate or assessment of
efficiency. An amount of $441,878.77 (out of the earmarked $534,000) was spent to achieve the
TA outcome only to have the government request a new and more comprehensive institutional
strengthening package from ADB. This is an indication that resources were not well spent.
Counterpart inputs did not occur due to political instability in Nepal during the course of TA
implementation.13 Several ADB missions were made. However, TA management failed to detect
the inadequacy of the consultants and the executing agency in achieving the TA outcome,
where corrective measures could have been developed and implemented immediately. With
regard to timeliness of outcomes, it was envisaged that consultants would closely coordinate
with the environmental advisor and trainer who will be attached to the Kali Gandaki
environmental unit to optimize training opportunities for both the TA and the Kali Gandaki
Project. This was not realized given the general unavailability of the staff for the seminars and
trainings, the government's failure to deliver its promise to increase staff at NEA-ED, and the
failure of the consultants and NEA to agree on a workable schedule. The TA is less likely (0.2)
to be sustainable. During implementation, there was (i) little evidence of support from senior
management and the NEA Board to affect any significant changes in the way NEA approaches
environmental and social issues, which was fundamentally a donor-driven exercise;
(ii) uncertainty of NEA's present mandate and future direction during implementation brought by
the then new environmental legislation; (iii) weak organizational loyalty by staff as loyalty was
associated to patrons, and lack of legitimate employee incentives; and (iv) there was lack of
staff at NEA-ED. Given these insufficiencies in human, institutional, and financial resources and
support, it is less likely that the TA outcome can be sustained.

25.        Overall assessment. The TA is rated partly successful in agreement with the TCR.
