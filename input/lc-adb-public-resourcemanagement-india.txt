ADB and Public Resource 
Management in India
 After independence in 1947, the Government of India promoted public enterprises as the 
 engine of economic growth. It applied controls on private sector participation, and on foreign 
 trade and investment. Later, in the mid1980s, economic liberalization, an expansionist fiscal 
 stance, and a hike in public sector wages boosted growth from 3.5% to 5% per year. 
 In India, state finances depend heavily on transfers from the center. By the early 1990s, fiscal 
 expansion and higher oil prices from the Gulf War had made state finances unsustainable. 
 In 1991, the Government initiated stabilization and structural adjustment to contain fiscal 
 imbalance. Thereafter, it encouraged multilateral development banks to partner with states. 
 Beginning in 1996, ADB approved program lending in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, 
 and Assam. How did ADBs support perform?
