Involvement of Civil Society

Organizations in ADB Operations
 ADB recognizes the growing role of civil society organizations in the Asia and Pacific 
 regions development, and interacts with them at international, country, and grassroots levels. 
 ADB policies acknowledge the importance of capacity building and institutional 
 development support to CSOs to strengthen this role in its operations. 
 The involvement of country CSOs, which include grassroots CSOs or communitybased 
 organizations, in ADB operations has not been analyzed or evaluated sufficiently. This gap 
 needs to be filled because ADB and the international community now place more emphasis 
 on the role of country systems and national organizations in leading the development agenda.
