ADB's Assistance for Domestic 
Capital Markets
 Strategy 2020 includes support for capital market development as one of the ADB's core 
 operational priorities, as it can facilitate private sector development and infrastructure 
 development, which rely on the availability of longterm local currency funds for viable 
 financial structures. 
 In 2008, the Operation Evaluation Department conducted its first evaluation1 of the 
 performance of ADB's public and private sector assistance related to the development of 
 policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks, and institutions for stock and bond markets.
