Energy Efficiency for a Better 
Future
 The Asia and Pacific region is consuming a growing share of the worlds total primary 
 energy supply. This grew from 13% in 1973 to 25% in 2003. Although use per capita is low, it 
 will increase as incomes and standards of living improve. Regional consumption is expected 
 to rise by 89% and account for 30% of the worlds by 2030. 
 How can the Asia and Pacific region meet demand for energy in the most cost effective and 
 environmentally sustainable manner? What are the inherent conflicts and issues in 
 developing infrastructure for the energy sector? How might ADB help?
