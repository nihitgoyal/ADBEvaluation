Energy Efficiency, Security, and 
Conservation in India
 Energy is vital to economic growth and poverty reduction. In the last 30 years, productivity 
 and wealth have risen rapidly in Asia and the Pacific--so has dependence on energy. 
 Indias economy grew by about 6% per annum in the 1990s and by about 8% in recent years. 
 The energy policy of India has been shaped by fast economic growth, but also by increasing 
 household incomes, limited domestic reserves of fossil fuels, and environmental impacts. 
 ADB and India partnered in the energy sector 20 years ago. What have been the results? 
 How can ADB now promote energy efficiency, energy security, and energy conservation?
