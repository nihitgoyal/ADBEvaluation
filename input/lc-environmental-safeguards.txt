ADBs Environmental Safeguards
                                                                                                                           January 2007
 The one size fits all approach is not effective. It fails to add value in many cases. 
 There is an overemphasis on procedural compliance. Not enough attention is paid to results 
 delivery. 
 There is a perverse incentive for ADB lending decisions to be actively directed to avoid 
 financing projects that might trigger environmental procedures. 
 Environmental safeguards and environmental enhancement are two sides of the same coin. 
 One should not be overemphasized at the expense of the other. 
 Mainstreaming may have inadvertently reduced the visibility of environmental issues within 
 ADB activities. 
 The quality of environmental assessments was found to be inconsistent and often did not 
 reflect current international good practice.
