Focusing on Results in the 
Transport Sector of India
 Transport connects resources and markets, diversifies production, develops trade, and in so 
 doing facilitates economic growth. Rural roads can also benefit the poor. 
 The Government of India has made efforts to modernize, expand, and integrate transport in 
 India. Notwithstanding the robust development outlook, billions of dollars are needed to 
 sustain these efforts. As it improves public sector performance and accountability and acts as 
 enabler rather than producer, the Government can mobilize private sector participation to 
 bridge the resource gap and increase operational and managerial efficiency. 
 ADBs infrastructure operations are in demand and ADB and India have worked on 
 transport for twenty years. As of end2006, ADB had made 25 loans totaling $5.28 billion to 
 the transport sector of India, or about one third of ADBs lending to the country. How has 
 ADBs assistance performed? What strategic positioning should it adopt now?
