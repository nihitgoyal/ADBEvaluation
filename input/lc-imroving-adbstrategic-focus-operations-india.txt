Improving ADBs Strategic Focus 
and Operations in India
 India has made fast economic progress in the last decade but still battles high levels of 
 poverty. 
 Traditionally, ADBs lending and technical assistance to the country have focused on 
 infrastructure. Was ADBs operational focus appropriate for supporting sustainable 
 economic growth and poverty reduction? How has ADBs assistance performed? How might 
 ADBs strategic focus and operations be improved? The findings of an evaluation of ADBs 
 country assistance program in India have implications for resource allocation, design and 
 focus of operations, program management, and business processes.
