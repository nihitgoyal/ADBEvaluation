ADBs Indigenous Peoples 
Safeguards
 Indigenous peoples are among the poorest people on earth. Many are threatened with 
 marginalization or extinction of their lives, livelihoods, cultures, and languages. Concerns 
 include cultural and linguistic preservation, land rights, ownership and exploitation of 
 natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation, 
 poverty, health, and discrimination. 
 The United Nations reckon indigenous peoples at 300­370 million worldwide, composed of 
 over 5,000 distinct groups in 70 countries on five continents. About 150 million of them live in 
 Asia and 68 million are scheduled tribes in India (Adivasis). The United Nations estimate 
 corresponds to a more restrictive definition of indigenous peoples. ADB counts more. 
 ADBs Policy on Indigenous Peoples of 1998 defines indigenous peoples more expansively 
 as peoples with a social or cultural identity distinct from the dominant or mainstream society. 
 The policy, as operationalized by ADBs Operations Manual, is perceived by ADB project 
 mission leaders to be difficult to apply. The provisions can be onerous. Some developing 
 member countries argue that required compliance has become a disincentive to seeking ADB 
 financing; others claim that their policies are of acceptable standard and that ADB must 
 become more flexible. Nongovernment organizations contend that consultations, public 
 disclosure, implementation, and monitoring should be improved.
