ADBs Involuntary Resettlement 
                                                                                                                    January 2007

Safeguards
 The scope of the original Policy on Involuntary Resettlement has expanded since the issuance 
 of the Handbook on Resettlement in 1998 and ADBs reorganization in 2002, which brought 
 with it a new safeguard compliance mechanism and a new section in ADBs Operations 
 Manual. Through the new de facto policy, ADB practice is now much more inclusive than 
 the title of the policy suggests. It now focuses not only on people affected by involuntary 
 resettlement, but also on those who experience land loss and loss of livelihood as a result of 
 an ADBsupported project. The procedures have also become more elaborate and 
 prescriptive over the years. Formal compliance has been stressed and requires a signoff by 
 the chief compliance officer on the quality of resettlement planning before loan appraisal. 
 This has caused staff of ADB to be much more demanding of executing agencies. 
 The Policy on Involuntary Resettlement is highly controversial. Many borrowers and 
 executing agencies think that the policy is not compatible with national laws and policies, 
 and too expensive. Some civil society organizations think that it is not sufficiently well 
 implemented. Some staff of ADB lament that the policy is laborintensive given staff 
 constraints and may take resources away from other necessary and equally important project 
 preparation tasks.
