 ADB Interventions on Nutrition 
and Food Fortification
 Nutrition is central to the accomplishment of the Millennium Development Goals, 
 particularly those to achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and 
 empower women; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; and combat HIV/AIDS, 
 malaria, and other diseases. It is also integral to the Millennium Development Goal to 
 eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. 
 The general discussion of nutrition seen in the 1960s has been replaced by nutrientspecific 
 strategies. Fortification has been promoted as the most cost effective nutrition intervention. 
 In countries where development has proceeded rapidly, the problem of overnutrition is 
 emerging rapidly, which increases risk for several chronic diseases. 
 Urbanization and increases in life expectancy have changed the demographic profile of Asia 
 and the Pacific. More effort is needed to develop effective nutrition programs for all types of 
 nutrition risks.
