Harnessing PrivatePublic 
Synergies
 The private sector is generally regarded as the engine of economic growth and job creation 
 and thus as a major contributor to poverty reduction. 
 To provide better services to their clients and increase the probability of achieving 
 development results, international finance institutions know that they must (i) move away 
 from providing funding to the private sector through stateowned development finance 
 institutions, (ii) sharpen the focus of their private sector strategies on strengthening enabling 
 environments, and (iii) increase investments funded through their private sector operations. 
 In its private sector operations, is ADB doing the right thing? Is it doing things right? Is it 
 adding value?
