Project Cost Estimates
 Cost underruns and overruns can be defined as the difference in the estimate of project costs 
 upon which loan approval is based, and the final cost incurred at project completion. 
 Of all Asian Development Bank (ADB)financed projects completed since 1995, 35% had a cost 
 underrun higher than 20% of the estimated project cost, and 9% a cost overrun higher than 20%. 
 Put together, almost half of the projects were characterized by inaccurate cost estimates. 
 Cost underruns lead to loan cancellations and these impact both borrowing countries and 
 ADBs operations. In the former, loan savings could have financed additional projects and, if 
 ADB financing is from ordinary capital resources, unduly large loans incur unnecessary 
 commitment fees. For ADB, cost underruns indicate inefficient allocation of scarce resources.
