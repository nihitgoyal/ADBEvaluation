 Does urbanization in Asia need special attention by ADB? 
 How much would need to be invested in urban development in Asia? 
 What is the nature of ADBs urban sector strategy, the context of its issuance in 1999, and 
 what affected it afterward? 
 Are the ambitions of the ADBs urban sector strategy being achieved? 
 How does ADBs urban sector strategy rate in terms of relevance and efficiency, and how do 
 urban sector operations rate in terms of their effectiveness and sustainability? 
 What are clients perceptions of ADBs valueadded in the urban sector and transaction costs? 
 What could be suggestions for a revised urban sector strategy, emerging from an evaluation 
 of past and current operations?
