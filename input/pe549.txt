                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


                                 The private sector does it better


       In 1988, when the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved its first
telecommunications project in India, telecommunications services in the country were
characterized by low levels of access and poor quality. Most of India's telecommunications
plants and equipment were old, of poor quality, and technologically obsolete.
Telecommunications was a public sector monopoly and the Government of India was the sole
provider of telecommunications services. A small number of state-owned enterprises had
responsibility for supplying virtually all telecommunications equipment.

        The main objective of the Telecommunications Project (Loan 886-IND), approved on 4
April 1988, was to improve the quality of domestic telecommunications services and expand
international telecommunications facilities to help meet growing demand. Improved
telecommunications were expected to help eliminate infrastructure bottlenecks and promote
growth in the commercial and industrial sectors. ADB provided $135 million from its ordinary
capital resources to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project. The actual project
cost at completion amounted to $152.8 million, with a foreign exchange cost of $88.2 million (58
percent of the actual total cost) and a local currency cost of $64.6 million. The actual cost of the
Project was about 38 percent less than the appraisal estimate because of lower equipment
prices.

       The Telecommunications Project was expected to have been implemented over a four-
year, eight-month period, beginning in January 1988 and ending in August 1992. However,
project delays began in the fourth quarter of 1989 when the Government suspended
implementation to conduct a review of the telecommunications sector by a telecommunications
commission. The suspension lasted about two years. Delays of an additional two years were
experienced because the Government failed to issue import licenses for some of the project
components. When Project implementation resumed, further delays occurred because of the
need to revise tender documents, tender evaluation, and contract awards. This was aggravated
by inexperience and unfamiliarity with ADB procedures. As a result of these delays,
implementation took nine and a half years.

        Even while the first telecommunications project was experiencing delays, ADB approved
Loan 954-IND for the Second Telecommunications Project on 9 February 1989 for $118 million
from its ordinary capital resources to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project.
The actual project cost at completion amounted to $101.6 million, with a foreign exchange cost
of $68 million (67 percent of the actual total cost) and a local currency cost of $33.6 million. The
actual cost of the Project was about 60 percent less than the appraisal estimate because of
lower equipment prices and the cancellation of a project component. The local cost component
was lower because of a change in Government policy on taxes and duties. The second Project
was to help expand and improve the quality of telecommunications services, and improve the
efficiency of telecommunications equipment manufacturing. Improved telecommunications was
expected to help promote growth in the commercial and industrial sectors.
                                                 ix


       The Government's decision to conduct a review of the telecommunications sector also
affected the second Project. The Project was expected to take about three and a half years to
complete from July 1988, when advance procurement was authorized by ADB, to project
completion in December 1991. However, overall implementation also took nine and a half
years. The main reasons for the delays were the need to retender contracts, a shortage of
funds to pay customs duties on some equipment, the slow performance of some suppliers, and
a delay in issuing import licenses.

         No project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) was provided to prepare a
preliminary design for either project and to assess its technical, financial, and economic
feasibility. Moreover, ADB did not do sufficient economic analysis in the telecommunications
sector to underpin the rationale for the projects. PPTAs should have been undertaken to clarify
the need for the projects and identify key policy issues.

        Notwithstanding the long delay, the components of the first Project were implemented
satisfactorily. The three satellite earth stations and the associated equipment generated
substantial economic and financial benefits and high internal rates of return. However, some of
the components are underutilized because of inappropriate technology or inadequate
marketing. The second Project was implemented partly satisfactorily. The conversion to
polyethylene insulated jelly filled (PIJF) cable production was successful. However, the concast
copper rod facility is still not in operation, and the thermo-shrink jointing kits, and telephone and
other cord production facilities are idle and will probably never operate. The inability to compete
with the private sector in PIJF cable production and the low international prices for PIJF cable
made the PIJF cable component economically unviable.

        The executing agencies for the first Project are in a good financial position to ensure
project sustainability. However, Hindustan Cables Limited (HCL) is in a precarious financial
position and the second Project is not sustainable without Government budgetary support.
HCL's inability to effectively compete with the private sector in price is the main reason for its
small share of the PIJF market.

          The experience with the two Projects highlights one major issue. The
telecommunications industry is a rapidly changing one with new technologies becoming
available frequently. To keep up with these advances, telecommunications companies need
flexibility in their investment decisions and the marketing of their services. Public sector
enterprises are not suited to operating in the telecommunications sector.

       This project performance audit finds that both Projects were unsuccessful. The rationale
of the first Project was weak and project preparation was poor. The Government's initial
decision to cancel a major portion of the loan as a result of a telecommunications sector review
should have been supported by ADB, rather than convincing it to reverse its decision. The
major objective of the Project (supporting economic growth) was achieved to a limited extent,
although several components of the Project are either underutilized or not in use. The Project
was not accompanied by any policy reforms to place the telecommunications sector on a
sounder economic footing and there was no evidence that the Project benefited the poor.

        The rationale of the second Project was also weak and project preparation poor. The
Project added telephone cable manufacturing capacity in an area where the private sector
adequately met the market demand. HCL is inefficient and cannot compete with the private
sector. Thus, the Project is not sustainable without government support. The Project did not
                                                x


succeed in achieving its objective of improving the efficiency of telecommunications equipment
manufacturing.

       The evaluation demonstrated the need for a sound project rationale. It should be based
on a well-defined and focused country operational strategy, supported by PPTA. A PPTA
should be mandatory if there is little or no experience in the sector. Project preparation should
include an assessment of the sector's policy environment and the scope for private sector
involvement in the sector. Support for interventionist government policies is not appropriate.
Project preparation should also assess the institutional capabilities of the executing agency and
ensure that sufficient consulting services are provided during project implementation.

        Project administration also needs to closely monitor the policy environment in which a
project is being implemented, in addition to its usual activities regarding procurement and other
implementation activities. Any major changes should be assessed in light of the project's
rationale and objectives, and the economic and financial feasibility of the project should be
reassessed to ensure continued relevance. If the rationale is no longer relevant or the project is
no longer viable, steps should be taken to terminate the project.
                                    I.      BACKGROUND



A.     Rationale


1.       Telecommunications services in India in 1988 were characterized by low levels of
access and poor quality. The average telephone density was 0.52 direct exchange lines per 100
people, one of the lowest in Asia. The average waiting time for obtaining a telephone
connection was more than three years. Most of the country's telecommunications plants and
equipment were old, of poor quality, and technologically obsolete. Congestion and fault rates
were high. Telecommunications was a public sector monopoly, with the Government as the sole
provider of telecommunications services. A small number of state-owned enterprises had
responsibility for supplying virtually all telecommunications equipment. Recognizing that poor
telecommunications were a serious impediment to economic growth, the Government
embarked on a program of modernization and expansion, mainly through the introduction of
digital technology, under the 1986-1990 seventh five-year plan. Restrictions on the import of
advanced technologies were to be eased and domestic equipment manufacturing was to be
gradually liberalized. Efficiency and effectiveness were also to be improved through institutional
reforms. The modernization drive was to be underwritten by external financing, including
financing from multilateral sources.


B.     Formulation


2.      The Telecommunications Project was first brought to the attention of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) during the 24 November­4 December 1986 country programming
mission to India. A reconnaissance mission was fielded in February 1987 to decide on the
components to be included in the Project. However, because of incomplete documentation, a
follow-up reconnaissance mission in August 1987 was required to complete project preparation.
A contact mission was then fielded in October 1987 to continue the preparation of the Project,
and was subsequently upgraded to a fact-finding mission. The ADB appraisal mission visited
India from 24 November to 12 December 1987. The Telecommunications Project loan was
approved by ADB's Board of Directors on 7 April 1988. This was ADB's first loan to the
telecommunications sector in India.

3.       The Government lacked the resources for financing some of the components of its
investment plan for telecommunications. These components became the basis for the
Telecommunications Project. The Project was formulated as a set of disjointed components
that, in some cases, did not seem to have a strong rationale. The Project was not coordinated
or monitored as part of an overall investment plan including other funding organizations, such
as the World Bank. ADB staff in charge of project preparation were not successful in
introducing any policy measures into the Project because of strong Government resistance to
                                                              2

                                                                                      1
policy conditionalities. The Government's stance was supported by senior staff in ADB. In
short, project preparation was weak and the Project lacked focus.




1
    Government officials had direct contact with ADB headquarters during the preparation of the Project, according to
    ADB mission staff. Thus, mission staff were not in a strong position to negotiate policy conditions for the Project. The
    lack of policy conditionalities under the Telecommunications Project was a major concern of some members of ADB's
    Board of Directors.
                                                 3


4.      The Government of India requested the Second Telecommunications Project during the
1-12 February 1988 country programming mission. A reconnaissance mission was fielded in
May-June 1988 to carry out preparatory work on the Project. This was subsequently upgraded
to a fact-finding mission. The appraisal mission visited India in July-August 1988. The Second
Telecommunications Project (the second Project) loan was approved by ADB's Board of
Directors on 9 February 1989, less than a year after approval of the Telecommunications
Project (the first Project).

5.       No project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) was provided to prepare a
preliminary design for either project and to assess its technical, financial, and economic
feasibility. Since India had begun borrowing from ADB only in 1986, ADB had not done
sufficient economic or sector analysis to clarify the rationale for the projects. Even though there
was a major lack of understanding of the sector's policy issues, ADB seemed keen to quickly
enter a sector in which it had little experience. There was no justification for dispensing with the
PPTAs; it would have been highly desirable to implement one for each project to justify the
need for each project and identify key policy issues. Although ADB's Board of Directors noted
these weaknesses during the discussions on loan approvals, it nevertheless gave its approval.

6.      The Board of Directors also noted that the first Project lacked policy content. A major
weakness that the Board identified was the lack of measures to privatize the telecommunications
sector and the lack of cofinancing in the sector by commercial sources. Some Board members felt
that ADB should not finance telecommunications in India because the World Bank and other
funding agencies were already providing substantial assistance. But the extent of ADB's
coordination with the World Bank and other aid agencies was not evident from the Project
documents. The Board also noted weaknesses in the financial position of some of the executing
agencies and a lack of rationale for some project components. In the case of the second Project,
two Board members abstained from voting on the loan. Board members pointed out that
telecommunications was highly protected in India, ADB had no country strategy to guide its
program of assistance, and the Government's policy to liberalize and deregulate the sector was
vague. It was also pointed out that the Project seemed to be hastily put together and the
evaluation in the project documents was superficial. Several Board members did not agree with
the inclusion of the three technical assistance (TA) components in the Project.

7.      In November 1989, the Government notified ADB that it intended to cancel $114 million
of the $135 million first Project and was likely to cancel the entire second Project as well
because of changes in its telecommunications policy related to procurement of equipment from
domestic sources. A formal request was made to cancel the $114 million in March 1990, but the
Government changed its mind and reaffirmed its support for the second Project. The
Government reversed its decision to cancel the $114 million in September 1991 on the advice
of the ADB.

8.      ADB project staff confirm that ADB actively pursued the reversal of the Government's
decision to cancel the major portion of the first Project. The motives are unclear, but it was
apparently not for economic or technical reasons. As the PPAR will show, it would have been
better to cancel the loan as requested or, at the least, reformulate the Project.

C.        Purpose and Outputs

9.       The main objective of the first Project was to improve the quality of domestic
telecommunications services and expand international telecommunications facilities to help
meet growing demand. Improved telecommunications were expected to help eliminate
infrastructure bottlenecks, and promote growth in the commercial and industrial sectors. The
Project had seven components: (i) modernization of manual trunk services by providing and
installing computerized digital trunk manual exchange (CDTMX) equipment at 8 locations; (ii)
improvement of domestic satellite facilities at 12 locations by providing intermediate digital rate
(IDR) equipment to enable digital transmission; (iii) upgrading of international gateway
telephone exchange (IGTX) facilities at Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai; (iv) establishment and
expansion of IGTX at Calcutta in two phases; (v) establishment of an International
Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) F2-type earth station at Calcutta; (vi)
establishment of an INTELSAT A-type earth station near Calcutta; and (vii) establishment of an
International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT) C-type coast earth station near
Mumbai.

10.       The objective of the second Project was to help expand and improve the quality of
telecommunications services, and improve the efficiency of telecommunications equipment
manufacturing. A secondary objective was the institutional strengthening of the Department of
Telecommunications (DOT) and the Ministry of Industry's Department of Public Enterprises
through the provision of technical assistance. Improved telecommunications were expected to
help promote commercial and industrial growth. The Project had six components: (i) provision
and installation of equipment to convert cable manufacturing by Hindustan Cables Limited
        2
(HCL) at Hyderabad and Rupnarainpur from paper-covered unit twin to polyethylene insulated
jelly filled (PIJF), with a total installed capacity of 2.5 million conductor kilometers (ckm), and
convert HCL's production of coaxial cables to PIJF at Rupnarainpur, with a total installed
capacity of 0.6 million ckm; (ii) civil works, and provision and installation of equipment to
establish a new unit for PIJF cable production at Rupnarainpur, with a total installed capacity of
1.8 million ckm; (iii) provision and installation of equipment, and technical collaboration to
manufacture thermo-shrink jointing kits at Rupnarainpur; (iv) provision and installation of
equipment, and technical collaboration to manufacture telephone cords at Rupnarainpur; (v)
provision of equipment to augment HCL's research and development (R&D) at Hyderabad and
establish a new R&D unit at Rupnarainpur; and (vi) provision of raw materials for trial-run
operations of components (i) to (iv).


D.        Cost, Financing and Executing Arrangements


11.    ADB approved Loan 886-IND: Telecommunications Project for $135 million from its
ordinary capital resources on 4 April 1988 to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the
Project (Basic Project Data and Appendix 1). The Government provided budgetary support for
the local costs incurred by the Department of Telecommunications. The executing agencies,
                                              3                                             4
Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL),

2
    HCL is a wholly Government-owned telephone cable manufacturing enterprise.
3
    MTNL provides telecommunication services in Delhi and Mumbai. It is a publicly traded company with Government
    majority ownership.
                                                             5


financed the local costs of their components from their own resources. The loan had a term of
24 years, including a grace period of 4 years, with interest determined in accordance with the
pool-based variable lending rate system and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum.
ADB financing covered 55 percent of the total project costs of $247 million as estimated at
appraisal. The borrower was India. The Government re-lent the loan funds to MTNL and VSNL
             5
at 18 percent for 12 years, with no grace period. The Government bears the foreign exchange
risk.

12.      ADB approved Loan 954-IND: Second Telecommunications Project for $118 million from
its ordinary capital resources on 9 February 1989 to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of
the Project (Basic Project Data and Appendix 2). The executing agency, HCL, financed the
local cost components. The loan had a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 4 years,
with interest determined in accordance with the pool-based variable lending rate system and a
commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum. ADB financing covered 46 percent of the total
project costs of $254 million as estimated at appraisal. The borrower was India. The
Government re-lent the loan funds to HCL at rates in accordance with the Government's
standard financing arrangements for development assistance to public sector undertakings and
not less than that charged on loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources. Repayment was
over 15 years with a 4-year grace period. The Government bears the foreign exchange risk.


E.         Completion and Self-Evaluation


13.      A project completion report (PCR) for the Telecommunications Project was prepared in
December 1997 and discusses the design, scope, implementation, and operational aspects of
the Project, and provides detailed project information. The PCR was well prepared and the
technical assessment was thorough. However, the economic and financial reevaluations used a
different approach from that in the appraisal report. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR)
and the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) were based on time-slice analyses whereas the
appraisal analyses had been done by component. Since the benefits can be separately
identified for most components, EIRRs and FIRRs should have been calculated for each
component. The PCR rated the Project as partly successful.

14.    The PCR for the Second Telecommunications Project was prepared in September 1997
and also discusses the design, scope, implementation, and operational aspects of the Project,
and provides detailed project information. The PCR was adequately prepared from a technical
perspective, but it did not sufficiently cover the financial, economic, and institutional aspects of
the Project. Although HCL was obviously in financial difficulty, the PCR was still optimistic about
HCL's and the Project's prospects. The policy issues that arose from the introduction of
competition in the industry were not discussed. The Project was rated as partly successful.

15.     This project performance audit report (PPAR) focuses on the pertinent aspects of the
two Projects, and presents the findings of the Operations Evaluation Mission to India from 16-
31 March 2000. The PPAR assesses the projects' relevance, effectiveness in achieving their
objectives and generating benefits, and the sustainability of their impacts.

16.      The PPAR is based on a review of the PCRs, the appraisal reports, material in ADB
files, a report by a consultant engaged by the Operations Evaluation Mission, and discussions
with staff members of ADB, the Borrower, and the executing agencies. Copies of the draft
PPAR were provided to the Borrower, the executing agencies, and the concerned ADB staff for
review and comments. Their comments were taken into consideration in finalizing the report.



                II.     PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION PERFORMANCE



A.     Formulation and Design


17.     ADB's role in India's development process, according to the Report and
Recommendation of the President, was "to provide well-directed and sustained financial
assistance in consonance with the Government's own development objectives, priorities, and
programs." The operational strategy was "focused on rapid industrialization of the economy,
one of the Government's most important objectives." The two projects were consistent with the
operational strategy, even though experience had demonstrated that industrialization through
public sector investment is generally not efficient and often leads to serious resource
misallocation. Moreover, poverty in India was, and still is, endemic with more than half the
population living on less than a dollar a day. The project designs did not include any elements
specifically for poverty reduction.

18.     With the exception of the CDTMX component, the telecommunications equipment
appears to have been appropriate and according to industry standard. The CDTMX equipment
is industry standard, but it is questionable whether it was appropriate at the time of project
appraisal. DOT and MTNL knew that manual trunk traffic would decrease as subscriber trunk
dialing (STD) facilities increased, and the writing of customized software to copy a manual
operator trunk desk is not generally considered good practice. Nevertheless, the Government
insisted on this approach and ADB acceded to its wishes.

19.      The first Project underwent substantial design changes during implementation because
of the availability of savings in the project cost resulting from lower than expected prices. The
number of CDTMX facilities to be procured was increased from 8 to 14. IDR equipment was
provided at 4 more locations in addition to the 12 locations envisaged at appraisal. The
upgrading of IGTX facilities was expanded to increase the circuit handling capacity of these
facilities by a factor of 3 in Mumbai, 5 in Delhi, and 10 in Chennai. The circuit handling capacity
of the IGTX facilities at Calcutta was increased by a factor of 4. An additional INTELSAT A-type
earth station was established near Chennai. A very small aperture terminal (VSAT) hub station
with a capacity of 200 VSAT stations was established near Mumbai. Digital microwave links
were installed between Delhi and Dehradun, and between Mumbai and Arvi. The upgrading of
the IGTX facilities, the addition of the INTELSAT station, and the digital microwave links
strengthened the Project; the other design changes did not. ADB approved two changes in
scope, one in 1991 and one in 1992. Given the number and scope of changes, the whole
Project should have been reappraised and redesigned.

20.    From a technical perspective, the design of the second Project seems to have been
appropriate. The changes in scope were related more to changes in the size of the components
rather than their objectives. The establishment of a new PIJF cable production facility at
                                                            8


Rupnarainpur was canceled because of the Government's policy of encouraging more private
sector involvement in the production of PIJF cable. A new component was introduced to
                 6
produce concast copper rods for the production of PIJF cables. This was supposed to reduce
the expenditure on imported copper cathodes. As a result, concast copper rods were added to
the raw materials component for the trial production runs. The scope of the component for the
production of coiled and straight telephone cords was expanded to include the production of
other electronic cords. HCL said it had identified a market opportunity to sell computer and
other similar cords. However, HCL provided no evidence of such an opportunity. Production of
these cords is a relatively simple process and the private sector satisfactorily met the market
demand for telephone and other electronic cords. HCL had no obvious competitive advantage
in the production of these items. Thus, there was no strong justification for including this
component in the Project.

21.    The second Project included three TAs, for (i) management training of DOT staff, (ii) a
study of DOT specifications for PIJF cables, and (iii) a study of industrial engineering standards
and costing systems. The latter two TAs were subsequently canceled because DOT felt that
the TA for the specifications study was inadequately formulated, and HCL had already
embarked on a computerization program.


B.        Cost and Scheduling


22.     At appraisal, the first Project was estimated at $247 million, comprising a foreign
currency cost of $135 million and a local currency cost of $112 million. ADB provided a loan of
$135 million representing 55 percent of the total cost, while the Government and its agencies
were to provide the balance to finance the remaining 45 percent of the total cost. The actual
project cost at completion amounted to $152.8 million, with a foreign exchange cost of $88.2
million (58 percent of the actual total cost) and a local currency cost of $64.6 million. The actual
cost of the Project was about 38 percent less than the appraisal estimate because of lower
equipment prices, even though additional components were included under the changes in
scope. An amount of $46.8 million was canceled from the loan.

23.     The second Project was estimated at $254 million at appraisal, comprising a foreign
currency cost of $118 million and a local currency cost of $136 million. ADB provided a loan of
$118 million representing 46 percent of the total cost, while HCL was to finance the remaining
54 percent of the total cost. The actual project cost at completion amounted to $101.6 million,
with a foreign exchange cost of $68 million (67 percent of the actual total cost) and a local
currency cost of $33.6 million. The actual cost was about 60 percent less than the appraisal
estimate because of lower equipment prices and the cancellation of a PIJF component under
the Project. The local cost component was smaller because of the Government's change in
policy on taxes and duties. An amount of $50 million was canceled from the loan.

24.    The first Project was expected to have been implemented over a four-year, eight-month
period, beginning in January 1988 and ending in August 1992 (Appendix 3). This seems to
have been a reasonable implementation schedule. However, project delays began in the fourth
quarter of 1989 when the Government suspended implementation to conduct a review of the
telecommunications sector by a telecommunications commission. The suspension lasted about

                                               9


two years. Delays of an additional two years resulted because the Government failed to issue
import licenses to VSNL for some of the project components. The Government suspension of
implementation led to further delays because of the need to revise tender documents, tender
evaluation, and contract awards. This was further aggravated by inexperience and unfamiliarity
with ADB procedures. As a result of these delays, implementation took nine and a half years.

25.     The Government's decision to review the telecommunications sector also affected the
second Project (Appendix 4). The Project was expected to take about three and a half years to
complete from July 1988, when advance procurement was authorized by ADB, to project
completion in December 1991. However, overall implementation took nine and a half years. The
main reasons for the delay were the need to retender contracts, a shortage of funds for HCL to
pay customs duties on some equipment, the slow performance of some suppliers, and a delay
in issuing import licenses.


C.     Consultant's Performance, Procurement and Construction


26.      Procurement for both projects was carried out according to ADB's Guidelines for
Procurement. Equipment for the first Project was procured under international competitive
bidding. Additional circuits for the IGTX expansion were procured by repeat order from the
original supplier after ADB approval was obtained. The preparation of CDTMX tender
documents was very slow and required extensive assistance from ADB staff as DOT was not
familiar with ADB procedures. Retendering was required for this component because the
Government suspended the Project. DOT took three years to prepare revised CDTMX tender
documents, conduct retendering, and award the contract, largely because of rapid
developments in digital switching technology and DOT's inability to come to a firm decision on
equipment needs. The contractor also had problems with developing the required customized
software; after 8 revisions and an additional 10 months, the electronic billing system was
commissioned in November 1997. Contracting for the VSAT equipment took more than two
years. The contract for the supply and installation of VSAT equipment did not provide for any
retension money to be paid on commissioning, as is the normal practice, so the supplier could
not be penalized for delays. DOT requested additional software for the VSAT hub during
installation, which caused some of the delays. The suppliers of the other components generally
performed satisfactorily. No consultants were engaged under the Project, although the provision
of consulting services for assistance in tendering would probably have avoided some of the
delays.

27.     Delays also occurred because of the Government's new policy on procurement of
equipment from domestic sources (para. 7). Bids already submitted were broken down by
component to identify components that could be contracted locally. The process of scrutinizing
each bid was time-consuming and caused additional delays as tenders had to be rewritten and
rebid. This fragmentation of contracts made it more difficult to integrate all components into a
working system. These delays also added to the risks associated with the selection of
technologies. Given the rapid pace of change in the telecommunications industry, technical
decisions seldom remain applicable for two years. The fragmentation of the bids to benefit a
local supplier is also unfair to other suppliers.

28.     Equipment (excluding R&D equipment) and raw materials for the second Project were
procured through international competitive bidding. International shopping was used for the
R&D equipment because no one supplier could provide all of the components. The supplier of
the jointing kits component provided and installed the necessary equipment, but failed to
                                                10


complete the final phase for the transfer of technology for the manufacture of "preforms." The
manufacture of preforms from raw materials is the initial stage of the production process and
the use of imported preforms was not seen as a commercially viable alternative. As a result of
this nonperformance, HCL initiated arbitration proceedings in June 1996; this legal action is still
ongoing and there is no firm date for this matter to be settled. The performance of the suppliers
of PIJF manufacturing, telephone cords, R&D facilities, copper rods, and raw materials
components was generally satisfactory. However, the installation of facilities for the
manufacture of the telephone and other cords, and for concast copper rods, was delayed
because the release of the plant and equipment from the Calcutta port was held up due to
HCL's lack of funds to pay for custom duties. With Government assistance, this plant and
equipment have now been delivered and agreements have been reached with the suppliers to
finish commissioning the facilities. HCL expects production from these facilities to commence
within a year. Like the first Project, no consultants were engaged.


D.     Organization and Management


29.     The first Project had three executing agencies. DOT served as the Executing Agency for
the CDTMX component outside Delhi and Mumbai, and for the domestic satellite and VSAT
components. MTNL was the Executing Agency for the CDTMX component in Delhi and
Mumbai, although DOT carried out the procurement on behalf of MTNL. VSNL was the
Executing Agency for the IGTX, earth stations, and digital microwave link components. Overall
coordination was through DOT's director of coordination and planning. The director of
coordination and planning supervised the implementation of the DOT components, and the
general manager (technical) and the general manager (switching planning), supervised the
MTNL and VSNL components, respectively. Supervisors of the MTNL and VSNL components
satisfactorily discharged their responsibilities. However, DOT did not have the capacity to
effectively implement its components of the Project. As a result, long delays occurred even
though advance procurement for some parts of the Project was approved by ADB.

30.     HCL was the Executing Agency for the second Project. The managing director, assisted
by the director (technical and planning), had overall responsibility for implementation. The chief
general manager (Hyderabad) and the chief general manager (Rupnarainpur) were responsible
for day-to-day implementation at their centers of production. HCL had difficulties implementing
the Project. Its financial position was weak and it had problems raising funds for the local cost
part of the Project. HCL lacked experience in contracting and selected a supplier (for the
jointing kits component) that was not able to supply the necessary technology. Furthermore, the
contract conditions between HCL and the supplier did not provide adequate assurance that the
technology transfer would be completed.

31.    The loan agreements for the two projects contained a number of covenants. In addition
to standard covenants related to reporting requirements and the use of loan proceeds, the Loan
Agreement for the first Project contained several project-specific covenants related to financial
performance. These covenants, except one, were complied with (Appendix 5). The Government
was required to furnish ADB with a report on the execution and initial operation of the Project.
However, this report was not received by ADB. The main loan covenants of the second Project
were also related to financial performance, as well as to the pricing of PIJF cable. However,
these were generally not complied with (Appendix 6). The covenanted 13 percent rate of return
                                                             11


on capital employed was not achieved and the financial targets were not amended when the
                                               7
Seventh Pricing Agreement was renegotiated. ADB made no apparent effort to amend the loan
covenant's financial targets. The action plan for strengthening HCL's efficiency and productivity
was only partly complied with.


                              III.        ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT PURPOSES



A.        Operational Performance

                                                                     8
32.     CDTMX facilities were successfully installed at 14 locations and operator training was
completed. During implementation, subscribers were beginning to shift from manually switched
trunk calls to subscriber trunk dialing (STD) because STD eliminated the need to use an
operator for intercity and other calls (Figure). There was also a proliferation of commercially
operated public calling offices that used STD. Thus, the number of manual trunk calls fell from
206 million in 1993 to 49 million in 1999 (Appendix 7). Therefore, the use of CDTMXs also fell.
Only about 30-40 percent of the CDTMX capacity is currently being utilized and use continues
to decline. Although a CDTMX can employ up to 150 operators, the Project's CDTMXs currently
employ on average 25 operators. There are no plans to use the CDTMXs for other services.

33.      The IDR equipment was meant to make more efficient use of the domestic satellite
                                                       9

    The Seventh Pricing Agreement stipulated that HCL would sell its output to DOT at cost plus 10 percent. This formula
    was extended under the Eighth Pricing Agreement that ran from 1989-1992. In 1992, the Pricing Agreement with DOT
    was terminated.

    The 14 locations are Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Ernakulam, Hyderabad, Indore,

routes with speed at 8 megabits per second and 11 at 2 megabits per second, all using 64
kilobit voice encoding). However, much of the intended cost saving from the IDR equipment
was negated by delays in implementing the component. The IDR equipment is operational but
the equipment is now used sporadically, in cases where there is equipment failure in other parts
of the network or during periods when the network cannot accommodate the volume of traffic.
                                                                                         10
Otherwise, the IDR equipment is idle. The rapid expansion of the fiber optic network has
made the IDR equipment largely superfluous.

34.      The VSAT hub station was established at Yeur near Mumbai and had a capacity of 200
VSAT stations. However, only 61 VSAT stations are installed at customer premises, about 75
percent at public sector institutions. The poor use of the VSAT stations is because of
competition from the private sector. About 9,000 VSAT terminals are presently in use in India.
DOT is weak in the marketing of the VSAT service and does not have flexibility in setting the
tariff. DOT is also reluctant to sell VSAT terminals, preferring lease arrangements. DOT also
required a bank guarantee that customers found onerous and expensive. This requirement has
now been removed. DOT currently has 138 customer terminals in stock, which it would like to
put into service.

35.     IGTX facilities at Chennai, Delhi, and Mumbai were upgraded from analog to digital, and
the circuit handling capacity of these facilities was expanded by a factor of 10 in Chennai, 5 in
Delhi, and 3 in Mumbai. A digital IGTX was established at Calcutta in two phases. Limited
capacity was installed in the first phase to better match capacity with demand. In the second
phase, circuit handling capacity was increased by a factor of four. Digital microwave links were
installed between Delhi and Dehradun, and between Mumbai and Arvi. The IGTX and digital
microwave links are operating as intended.

36.      The INTELSAT F2-type earth station was constructed at VSNL's office building in
Calcutta where the IGTX facilities were installed. This earth station provides international links
for IGTX in the first phase. Two other earth stations, both INTELSAT A-type, were established
at Halisahar (near Calcutta) and Thiruvalluvar (near Chennai). All are operating as intended. An
INMARSAT C-type coast earth station was established at Arvi, near Mumbai. The rate of
utilization of the INMARSAT station has fallen recently, from a traffic volume peak of 2.7 million
minutes in 1997 to 1.2 million minutes in 1999. Use is falling because the installed INMARSAT
station is based on an analog standard while the new standard is digital. VSNL expects traffic
volume for this facility to fall by about 20 percent each year over the next three years.


           2.       Second Telecommunications Project


37.     The conversion of HCL facilities at Hyderabad and Rupnarainpur from paper covered
unit twin production to PIJF added 2.5 million ckm of production capacity (Appendix 8). The
conversion of coaxial producing facilities to PIJF at Rupnarainpur added another 0.6 million ckm
in production capacity. These facilities are still in working order, but are housed in factory
buildings that were constructed in 1954 and show signs of advanced deterioration. The
standard of maintenance of the PIJF production equipment and the factory floor is low.
Equipment is not fine-tuned: chains on pumps are loose and brakes on take-up spools squeal.
Waste material from the production process is routinely left on the ground, plastics used in the

10
     Fiber optic technology was already in use worldwide during the preparation of the Telecommunications Project.
                                                             13


coating process are not adequately contained, and waste is not properly recycled. At the time of
the Operations Evaluation Mission, the factory floor had not been cleaned for some time and
may be a safety hazard. The amount of waste from the production process indicates
inefficiency. Waste is eventually placed outside on the factory grounds in open piles. In general,
the maintenance of the PIJF production facilities is inadequate, raising questions about how
long the equipment will last.

38.    HCL's total production capacity of PIJF cable is now 8.2 million ckm, up from 5.1 ckm in
1992. Production of PIJF cable at the new facilities began in 1993. However, actual production
of PIJF cable before 2000 was significantly less than capacity (Table 1).

The Project added 3.1 million ckm to HCL's PIJF capacity. However, the 5.1 million ckm of
original capacity could have produced all the PIJF cable demanded annually by DOT, except in
1995 (Appendix 8). Moreover, the private sector began PIJF cable production in 1989 and, by
1997, it had established about 40 million ckm of PIJF production capacity, compared to a total
demand of 26.5 million ckm. Today, the private sector capacity is about 80 million ckm and the
demand from DOT, the major buyer, is about 50 million ckm annually. Therefore, HCL is a
small player in the PIJF cable market. The private sector's involvement in PIJF cable production
brings into question the need to have augmented PIJF cable production capacity in HCL. The
Project should have been cancelled when the Government changed its policy to encourage
private sector investment in the telecommunications sector.

39.     HCL's inability to effectively compete with the private sector on price was the main
                                              11
reason for its small share of the PIJF market. Even though a plan was developed for HCL to
reduce costs and increase productivity as part of the loan's covenants, HCL was not able to
implement the plan with any great success because of a lack of Government support. HCL's
high cost structure was the result of a number of factors: (i) substantial surplus labor; (ii) above
market wage rates; (iii) a top-heavy management; (iv) high levels of social overheads, including
provision of housing, transport, health, education, and other benefits to staff; and (v)
burdensome bureaucratic procedures in managing the firm.

     DOT rates 60 percent of the tenders for PIJF cable on price, and the balance on delivery and quality.

40.     The Government became concerned about HCL's excess capacity and inability to
compete in the market. To improve HCL's competitiveness, the Government agreed to
subsidize the voluntary retirement of labor from HCL's workforce; HCL's workforce was reduced
                                                                                                   12
from 6,790 persons in 1995 to 5,134 in 1998. Today, the work force is about 4,400.
Nevertheless, the current workforce may still be too high. For example, the Rupnarainpur
factory employs about 2,000 persons. However, the factory uses about 370 persons for each of
three shifts, which is full capacity utilization. This indicates an excess of about 900 persons. The
Government also directed state-owned financial institutions to reduce the interest rate on loans
to HCL to 4-5 percentage points below the market rate. To improve capacity utilization, DOT
was directed to allocate 30 percent of its demand for PIJF cable in 2000 to HCL based on the
lowest bid price. The balance was allocated to the private sector based on tender submissions.
In 2001, the proportion allocated to HCL will be reduced to 25 percent and, in 2002, the
Government will review this policy. Giving HCL a share of the PIJF cable market at the behest
of the Government does not encourage efficiency and penalizes the more efficient private
producers.

41.     The equipment procured for the thermo-shrink jointing kits is stored in an unused,
locked factory building at HCL's Rupnarainpur site. It has been sitting unprotected, covered in
dust and cobwebs, for the past five years. The equipment seems to be deteriorating from
humidity and other natural causes. It is doubtful that this equipment could ever be used for the
purpose it was designed. The equipment for the production of telephone and other cords is
similarly stored, although it seems to be in better condition. HCL and the supplier of the
equipment have agreed to put this equipment into operation, but it is uncertain whether the
equipment is still in working condition. The facilities for the production of concast copper rods
were installed about a year ago, but are not yet in operation because of a lack of electronic
                                                        13
equipment to ensure an uninterruptible power supply. The equipment is in good condition and
should operate as designed when uninterruptible power is provided (assuming the facility is
soon put into operation). However, there is a risk that HCL will not hire skilled staff to monitor
and control the quality of the casting process. The R&D equipment, primarily cable testing
equipment, is in good working order.


B.         Performance of the Operating Entity



           1.       Telecommunications Project


42.     Three agencies implemented the components of the Telecommunications Project: DOT,
MTNL, and VSNL. DOT, renamed the Department of Telecom Services (DTS) in November
1999, operates independently from the Ministry of Communications and prepares its own
financial statements (Appendix 9). Over the past 10 years, this department has earned a profit
and a high rate of return on its fixed assets. It does not pay income tax but, if it had, it would still
be highly profitable. The tariff allowed by the Government is adequate to maintain DTS's good
financial position. Its debt load is relatively light with a debt-equity ratio of about 15 percent in


12
     The exact number of staff is not available for 2000.
13
     The electronic equipment would ensure that power is restored to the induction furnace within 60 seconds to prevent
     major damage caused by solidifying copper metal.
                                                 15


1999. MTNL is an independent, largely government-owned telecommunications company. Its
financial statements (Appendix 10) show that MTNL is profitable with a manageable debt load.
MTNL pays income tax and a regular dividend. MTNL's shares are listed on several stock
exchanges, including London. Its shares are expected to be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange next year. VSNL is also an independent, government-owned telecommunications
company. Its financial statements (Appendix 11) show that VSNL is profitable with virtually no
debt. VSNL pays income tax and a regular dividend. With an expanding telecommunications
market and falling equipment prices, economies of scale should ensure good financial
performance for DTS, MTNL, and VSNL, even without tariff increases.

43.      Components of the Project were designed to service the market for long distance calls,
both domestic and international. Some of the components provide services that can be
identified separately, such as incremental transmission capacity for long distance voice and
data services from the IGTX/earth stations, the intermediate digital rate equipment, the VSAT
hub, and the digital microwave links. The CDTMX component is an integral part of the overall
communications system and its benefits cannot be easily isolated. Nevertheless, some
judgment may be made on the impact of this component. Since the CDTMX facilities are
grossly underutilized and the trend to STD calls is firmly established, the expected economic
benefits of this component have clearly not been realized. The CDTMX was not a least cost
solution. Moreover, placing a long distance call via the CDTMX increases revenue to DTS and
MTNL by Rs5.00 (about $0.11). Therefore, there is little incremental financial benefit from the
CDTMX service and the FIRR is deemed negative. As pointed out in para. 33, the IDR
component is largely superfluous and consequently the economic and financial impacts of this
component are negative.

44.     The VSAT component is also grossly underutilized, with most of the VSAT terminals still
in storage. Nevertheless, the 61 VSAT terminals that have been leased to customers are
generating substantial revenue for DTS. For example, in 2000, revenues from the VSAT service
were double the initial capital cost of the VSAT hub and terminals. Also, the initial capital cost of
the investment was completely recovered in the first three years of operation. Therefore, the
calculation of an EIRR or FIRR would not result in any meaningful measure of economic or
financial performance. However, the use of scarce public resources has not been efficient. The
private sector has more flexibility and provides a more efficient service. Although this
component is financially successful, in economic terms, the private sector provides the service
at a lower cost.

45.    The economic benefits of the components for upgrading the IGTX facilities at Delhi,
Mumbai, and Chennai, expanding the IGTX facilities at Delhi, and installating the digital
microwave link from Delhi to Dehrandum cannot be estimated separately because these
components are relatively small and form an integral part of the whole international telephone
network. Nevertheless, the upgrading and expansion of these facilities were necessary from a
technical perspective because of the global shift from the analog to the digital standard.
Therefore, the economic and financial impact has been positive and substantial.

46.    The INMARSAT C-type coastal station, the expansion of the IGTX at Mumbai, and the
Arvi-Mumbai digital microwave link are part of the same network that provides marine
telecommunications. Therefore, these components are evaluated together, details of which are
found in Appendix 13. The calculation of the EIRR and the FIRR assumes that these
components require no incremental operating and maintenance costs, as advised by VSNL.
Since 1999, telecommunication traffic on the INMARSAT has been falling and is expected to fall
about 20 percent per annum because the INMARSAT coastal station is based on an outdated
analog standard. Nevertheless, the economic and financial benefits of this component have
                                                            16


been substantial. The composite EIRR for these components is 80.8 percent. The
corresponding FIRR is 50.2 percent.

47.     The two INTELSAT A-type earth stations at Calcutta and Chennai, the INTELSAT F2-
type earth station at Calcutta, and the IGTX equipment at Calcutta and Chennai form a unit that
may be evaluated together. As in the VSAT and INMARSAT components, the revenues
generated by this component have been substantial. By 1994, this component had recovered
the entire initial capital investment and, therefore, the calculation of an EIRR or FIRR would not
result in any meaningful measure of economic or financial performance. It may be safely
concluded that this component is successful from the economic and financial perspectives.


           2.       Second Telecommunications Project

                                                                         14
48.      HCL's financial position is precarious and deteriorating rapidly (Appendix 12). HCL has
been incurring increasing losses since 1996, losing a record $65 million in 1998. HCL`s equity
capital is negligible and is positive only because the Government is subsidizing HCL's losses.
Without Government assistance, HCL would quickly become insolvent. HCL seems to have
difficulty controlling its expenses. Although the workforce is being reduced, the company's wage
bill is still increasing. Staff welfare expenses are inordinately high. Interest payments are high
and form a major expenditure item. Although the Government has taken steps to improve
profitability (para. 40), it is uncertain whether these measures to turn HCL around financially will
be successful. In the meantime, the Government is likely to provide budgetary support to HCL
to maintain a company that is inefficient and whose product has little demand.

49.     The largest component of the Project was the PIJF cable conversion. The PPAR
reevaluates this component on the basis of a with and without project analysis. The concast
copper rod, R&D equipment, and raw material components are integral parts of the PIJF cable
production process. Subsequent to the approval of the Project, Government policy in the
telecommunications sector changed. The private sector was allowed to compete with HCL in
the production and sale of PIJF cable in 1989 and the demand for PIJF cable could have been
easily met without the Project (para. 38). Therefore, the net economic benefit of these
components is negative. The prudent course of action would have been to cancel the Project in
the early 1990s when it became obvious that the Project was not needed.

50.     Without the policy change allowing the private sector to enter the PIJF cable market,
could this Project component have been successful? Appendix 14 indicates that the Project
would still not have been economically viable. Based on 2000 labor, raw material, and utility
costs, an import price of $10.00 per ckm of PIJF cable at Calcutta, and the assumption of full
capacity utilization of the Project component, the Project has a negative net present value of
Rs1,616.7 million. There are three reasons for this outcome. First, HCL is an inefficient
producer because of its highly inefficient use of labor and the high cost of raw materials
purchased from other state-owned enterprises that are similarly inefficient. Second,
international prices of PIJF cable are low. And third, capacity was not fully utilized in the early
years of the Project when PIJF cable prices were higher.


14
     According to HCL's auditors, its financial position is worse than indicated in its financial statements. In 1998, HCL
     underreported depreciation expenses and made no provision for accrued leave liabilities or for bad and doubtful
     debts.
                                              17


51.      The components for the manufacture of thermo-shrink jointing kits and of telephone and
other electronic cords are not in operation. Given the amount of time that has passed since
expenditure on these facilities took place and the uncertainty about when production from these
facilities will begin, it is safe to assume that the EIRR and FIRR of these components are
negative.


C.     Sustainability


52.     DTS, MTNL, and VSNL are in a good financial position to ensure the Project's
sustainability. On the other hand, HCL is technically insolvent and bankrupt and could not
continue operating without Government budgetary support. Given India's vast developmental
needs, the Government can ill afford to prop up poorly managed companies such as HCL. With
a large number of private sector companies producing PIJF cable, there is no reason for the
public sector to be involved in this area. Divestiture of HCL or its assets should be considered
and supported by ADB.


               IV.      ACHIEVEMENT OF OTHER DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS



A.     Socioeconomic and Sociocultural Impacts


53.     The purpose of the first Project was to improve the domestic and international long
distance telephone service. The main beneficiaries of this Project were firms that conduct
business nationally and internationally, and households in the higher income brackets. Firms
benefited by improving their access to telecommunications that, in turn, improved their
efficiency and ability to compete. There is no evidence that the poor benefited from the Project
to any significant extent.

54.    The socioeconomic impact of the second Project is indirect. HCL requires budgetary
support to maintain solvency. These resources could be better used elsewhere, for example, to
augment Government poverty reduction programs. Therefore, the Project probably had a
negative income distribution effect. There were no gender-specific impacts in either project.


B.     Environmental Impacts


55.    The first Project had no apparent negative impact on the environment. The second
Project resulted in the production of some waste that was not disposed of in an optimal manner.
However, this waste is environmentally benign and does not create a hazard except, perhaps,
in terms of safety. Nevertheless, as waste builds up (assuming that production continues at the
present rate), HCL will need to develop a continuous, environmentally acceptable, disposal
process for it.
                                                         18


C.       Impacts on Institutions and Policy


56.     The first Project made no effort at institutional reform or capacity building. The Project
also had no measures to address the policy environment in which the telecommunications
sector operates. The lack of policy measures was at the insistence of the Government to which
ADB acquiesced (para. 3). The major effort of the second Project at institutional strengthening
                      15
was the training TA. Implementation took place from November 1993 to January 1995. The
objective of the TA was to strengthen the management capabilities of DOT's middle level
managers who are engaged in critical line functions. The areas of focus were (i) network
planning for forecasting the needs of the expanding telecommunications system and planning
for orderly growth and efficient operations; (ii) operational management to identify and solve
problems, monitor and control traffic flow, handle day-to-day routing operations, and organize
and schedule work activities; and (iii) development of management information systems to
satisfy key information requirements; build effective data bases; use computers to store,
process, and retrieve information; and monitor and measure performance.

57.     The main TA activities comprised (i) an initial training needs assessment that served as
a basis for selecting DOT participants and formulating training modules; (ii) design of course
          16
modules; and (iii) provision of four training courses of four weeks each at the consultant's
training college in the UK, each involving 10 senior DOT officials. The training courses provided
DOT managers with a basic foundation related to network expansion, improvement in the
quality of service, and technology change. However, senior DOT officials were not aware of the
training that was undertaken in DOT and therefore it is not possible to assess the impact of the
TA. The Project had no measures to address the policy environment of the telecommunications
sector.


                                     V.        OVERALL ASSESSMENT



A.       Telecommunications Project


58.    Relevance. The rationale for the Project was weak and project preparation was poor.
The motivation for the Project seemed to be to rapidly build up a loan portfolio in India. Project
preparation did not include a PPTA and the Project was designed in a piecemeal fashion. There
was a lack of understanding of the sector's policy issues and no economic or sector work was
undertaken in advance. Although the Project was apparently consistent with the Government's
development strategy and ADB's strategic objectives, investment in public enterprises is not the
optimal way to achieve these objectives. The Project did not attempt to bring about policy
reforms to place the telecommunications sector on a sounder economic footing. Moreover, the
Project supported and perpetuated Government policies in the sector that created economic

    TA 1123-IND: Management Training for Department of Telecommunications, approved on 9 February 1989 for
   $390,000. The Government signed the TA Agreement only in January 1991 because of its review of
   telecommunication policy.
16
    Course components consisted of (i) technical management skills, (ii) operational management skills, (iii) resource
   management, (iv) personal effectiveness skills, (v) change management, and (vi) a personal action plan. Visits to
   operational facilities such as customer service centers were included.
                                                           19


distortions. Opening telecommunications to the private sector would have had a greater
economic impact. The Project also had no specific measures to address the poverty issue.

59.    Efficacy. The major objective of the Project (supporting economic growth) may be said
to have been partly achieved. The Project improved the quality of telecommunications services
and helped to eliminate some infrastructure bottlenecks. However, not all of the components
contributed to the efficacy of the Project ­ the CDTMX, IDR and VSAT components are
underutilized. The introduction of the private sector in a competitive environment would have
been more effective in supporting economic growth.

60.      Efficiency. The economic and financial impacts of the first Project are mixed. The IGTX
facilities installed in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai and the digital microwave link from Delhi to
Dehrandum were required for technical reasons, so their economic and financial impact is
positive and substantial. The component comprising the INMARSAT C-type coastal station, the
IGTX facilities at Mumbai, and the Arvi-Mumbai digital microwave link is also a successful
investment with a high EIRR and FIRR. The two INTELSAT A-type earth stations at Calcutta
and Chennai, the INTELSAT F2-type earth station at Calcutta, and the associated IGTX
equipment have also resulted in substantial economic and financial benefits that exceed the
opportunity cost of capital. On the other hand, the CDTMX facilities are grossly underutilized
and the IDR equipment is not in use. These two components are not cost effective. Although
the VSAT component earns a high financial rate of return, the underutilization of the VSAT
facilities also results in a lack of cost effectiveness. The lack of policy content in the Project
perpetuated distortions in the market that result in a monopoly position for the
telecommunications service providers. The Project did nothing to improve economic efficiency
in the sector.

61.    Sustainability. The executing agencies for the Project are in a good financial position to
ensure the Project's sustainability.

62.     Institutional Development and Other Impacts. The Project provided no measures to
address institution development and socioeconomic issues. It is unlikely that any of the benefits
of the economic growth from the Project trickled down to the poor because long distance
telecommunications is a service primarily utilized and higher income groups. Therefore, the
Project has no perceivable impact on poverty

64.     Assessment of ADB and Borrower Performance. The performance of ADB was
unsatisfactory in two respects. First, during the preparation of the Project, ADB should have
insisted on policy conditions to deregulate and liberalize the telecommunications sector.
Second, it was inappropriate for ADB to lobby the Government to reverse its decision to cancel
the major portion of the Telecommunications Project loan.

65.     During the implementation of the Project, ADB sent seven review missions and four
special project administration missions. Additional review was provided by other ADB missions
to India. These missions mainly followed up on the progress of procurement of equipment for
the Project and provided assistance and advice in this regard. The review missions were not
effective in ensuring the timely completion of the Project. Overall, ADB performance was less
than satisfactory.

66.    The implementation performance of the Government was also less than satisfactory.
The Government delayed implementation by delaying the issuance of import licenses to the
executing agencies for equipment financed under the Project. Delays were also caused by the
Government's new procurement policy that required the fragmentation of tender bids to identify
components that could be contracted locally. Decision-making in the Government and
executing agencies was sluggish.


B.     Second Telecommunications Project


67.     Relevance. The rationale for the Project was also weak and project preparation poor.
Project preparation did not include a PPTA and there was no economic or sector work
undertaken in advance. The Project and HCL's financial position were inadequately appraised
during project formulation. There is no justification for ADB to finance public sector
manufacturing, particularly when public policy discourages private sector participation.
Moreover, the Government's policy to liberalize and deregulate the sector was vague. The
objective of improving commercial and industrial growth through provision of incremental
capacity for PIJF cable production was also spurious.

68.    Efficacy. The objective of the Project to expand and improve the quality of
telecommunications services and to improve the efficiency of telecommunications equipment
manufacturing was not achieved. The Project created excess capacity in telecommunications
equipment manufacturing. To date, the thermo-shrink jointing kit component, the telephone and
other cord production component, and the concast copper rod production component are not in
use.

69.     Efficiency. The PIJF cable production component of the second Project was not
needed because the private sector installed sufficient capacity to meet the demand for PIJF
cable. Moreover, HCL is an inefficient producer of PIJF cable. The thermo-shrink jointing kit
component, the telephone and other cord production component, and the concast copper rod
production component generate no economic benefits. Therefore, the net economic benefit of
the Project is negative. With the large number of private sector companies producing PIJF
cable, there is no reason for the public sector to be involved in this area. The Second
Telecommunications Project should have been canceled when it became evident that the
private sector had the capacity to meet market demand for PIJF cable.

70.    Sustainability. HCL is technically insolvent and bankrupt and cannot continue operating
without Government budgetary support. The Project is not sustainable.
                                                            22


71.      Institutional Development and Other Impacts. The Project provided three TAs for
institutional development. Two of the TAs were subsequently canceled, indicating a poor
assessment of institutional needs at TA formulation. The TA that was implemented in DOT
could not be assessed because DOT officials were not aware of the TA's impact or the
whereabouts of the trainees. Therefore, it may be concluded that the TA was not successful.
The Project had no impact on poverty.

72.     Overall Project Rating. Table 3 summarizes the overall assessment of the Project. The
Project is rated as unsuccessful.

73.     Assessment of ADB and Borrower Performance. The performance of ADB was
unsatisfactory. During the implementation of the Project, ADB fielded five review missions.
Additional review was also provided by other ADB missions to India. The review missions
focused largely on procurement, and did not adequately monitor the more substantive and
crucial operational aspects, such as the deterioration in HCL's financial position and the policy
environment.

74.     The implementation performance of the Government was also not satisfactory. The
Government delayed implementation by delaying the issuance of import licenses to the
executing agencies for equipment financed under the Project. Decision-making in the
Government and executing agencies was also sluggish. The Government was slow in reacting
to resolving HCL's problem of insufficient counterpart funds.


                       VI.       ISSUES, LESSONS AND FOLLOWUP ACTIONS



A.       Key Issues for the Future


75.      The telecommunications industry is a rapidly changing one with prices of equipment
falling and new technologies becoming available all the time. To keep up with these advances,
telecommunications companies need flexibility in their investment decisions and the marketing
of their services. It has long been understood that state-owned enterprises, in India and
                                                      23


elsewhere, do not have this required flexibility and need to overcome a certain amount of inertia
when making decisions. In the Telecommunications Project, this lack of flexibility has resulted in
the installation of some equipment that soon became obsolete. Given the characteristics of this
industry and public sector inefficiencies, the public sector is not suited to operate in the
telecommunications sector and manage the inherent risks.

76.     The Government has maintained high prices for telecommunications services in the face
of increasing economies of scale and falling equipment prices. This excess revenue has been
transferred to Government coffers in the form of income tax and dividends. In essence, the
state-owned telecommunications enterprises in India behave like monopolists. Economic theory
suggests that monopolies that keep prices above the competitive level result in net welfare
losses. Government policies that encourage this kind of monopoly should not be supported.
The appropriate policy initiatives in these circumstances should include privatization and
competition in the sector.
                           17
77.     Recent studies have demonstrated that the expansion of telecommunications into rural
areas has significant poverty impacts. An improvement in telecommunications benefits
commercially active rural people by improving their access to market information, such as
commodity prices, and making it easier to order supplies. This results in higher incomes.
Improved telecommunications links also encourage the establishment of service sector
businesses, such as tea shops, guest houses, and stores. Rural telecommunications improve
the delivery of social services. Reduced isolation encourages teachers and health workers to
move to remote areas. Better government administration and banking services have also been
attributed to access to telecommunications in rural areas. Governments should encourage the
private sector to invest in rural telecommunications.


B.         Lessons Identified


78.    The evaluation demonstrates the need for a sound project rationale. It should be based
on a well-defined and focused country operational strategy, supported by PPTA. A PPTA
should be mandatory if there is little or no experience in the sector. Project preparation should
include an assessment of the sector's policy environment and the scope for private sector
involvement in the sector. Support for interventionist government policies is not appropriate.
Project preparation should also assess the institutional capabilities of the executing agency and
ensure that sufficient consulting services are provided during project implementation.

79.     Project administration needs to closely monitor the policy environment in which a project
is being implemented, in addition to its usual activities regarding procurement and other
implementation activities. Any major changes should be assessed in light of the project's
rationale and objectives, and the economic and financial feasibility of the project should be
reassessed to ensure continued relevance. If the rationale is no longer relevant or the project is
no longer viable, steps should be taken to terminate the project.

80.   Project administration also needs to closely monitor tender evaluation and procurement
procedures to ensure that they conform to ADB guidelines. It is not acceptable for an executing

     Embassy in Nepal.

agency to fragment bids to identify components that could be contracted by other suppliers.
This practice is contrary to ADB guidelines and causes delays in implementation.
                                               25



C.     Follow-Up Actions


81.      Project administration staff in Infrastructure Department West should assist DTS in fully
utilizing the remaining VSAT terminals that are in storage. In particular, DTS should be
encouraged to sell these terminals on the same conditions that the private sector does, rather
than leasing them. Otherwise, ADB should engage the Government in a dialogue with a view to
DTS divesting itself of this component. This may be the better option. The matter should be
undertaken immediately to resolve the issue at the earliest possible time.

           ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL REEVALUATION OF THE INMARSAT
         C-TYPE COASTAL EARTH STATION AND ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS


A.     Economic Reevaluation

1.     The economic reevaluation of the INMARSAT C-type coastal earth station includes the
Mumbai international gateway telephone exchange and the Arvi-Mumbai digital microwave link
components of the Telecommunications Project. The life of the components is assumed to be
13 years, after which the equipment will be decommissioned. As advised by Videsh Sanchar
Nigam Limited, these components incur no incremental operating and maintenance costs.
Economic benefits are based on revenues, and consumer surplus is not considered in the
analysis. Financial benefits and costs are converted to economic benefits and costs using a
standard conversion factor of 0.8 up to 1993, and 0.9 thereafter. Taxes and duties are excluded
from the analysis. The analysis is carried out in 2000 prices.

                  ECONOMIC REEVALUATION OF PIJF CABLE CONVERSION
                            AND ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS


1.      The economic reevaluation of the polyethelene-insulated jelly-filled (PIJF) cable
conversion component includes the concast copper rod, research and development equipment,
and raw materials components. These associated components are integral to the production
process of PIJF cable. The economic life of these components is assumed to be 20 years. The
economic benefits are based on the international price of PIJF cable (currently about $10.0 per
conductor kilometer [ckm]) and full capacity utilization. PIJF cable is a traded good. Taxes and
duties are excluded from the capital and other costs, and costs of nontradables are converted to
economic values using a standard conversion factor of 0.8 up to 1993 and 0.9 thereafter. The
analysis is carried out in 2000 prices.
