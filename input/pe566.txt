                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


        The operational strategy for India of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in much of the
1990s was to assist the Government achieve increased economic efficiency through support for
structural reforms, promotion of competition, and private sector participation. The Hydrocarbon
Sector Program (HSP) loan was consistent with this strategy. It was also part of international
donor efforts to support India to diffuse its balance-of-payment crisis caused by the drying-up of
short-term credits and the surge of oil import costs due to the sharp oil price increases caused
by the Gulf crisis.

        On 17 December 1991, the Board approved the program loan for $250 million to be
disbursed in two tranches. In addition, cofinancing of $250 million from the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund of Japan was solicited and obtained, and two technical assistance (TA)
grants were provided to support the design and implementation of the Program. The first TA, for
$200,000, examined the performance of the public sector in oil refining, distribution, and
marketing activities, and the second TA, for $400,000, aimed to identify ways of promoting
private sector investment in downstream activities.

       The main objective of the Program was to promote accelerated exploration and
development of domestic hydrocarbon resources through increased participation of the private
sector and enhanced operational efficiency of public sector enterprises (PSEs). Specifically, the
Program aimed to contain the share of oil imports in total oil consumption at the 1991 level (45
percent). The Government considered the objective of long-term oil import substitution as
important from the viewpoint of reducing pressure on the foreign currency reserve as well as the
country's strategic self-reliance. The scope of HSP was to cover major areas including sectoral
policy and institutional reforms, attracting private sector investments, improving public sector
operational and financial efficiency, and promoting energy conservation and efficiency.

        The first tranche of $125 million was disbursed in two installments in December 1991
and February 1992. The Government proceeded to implement most of the reform measures
prescribed by the Program. The process, however, stalled with what was considered a key
covenant, namely the divestment of 20 percent of the Government's equity in the country's
leading oil company, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). The scheduled loan closing
date was 30 June 1995, but it was extended three times to allow more time for compliance.
Finally, the Government indicated that it was unable to meet the requirement and requested the
cancellation of the second tranche ($125 million). The loan was actually closed on 18
September 1997.

       The Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM), which visited the country during the period
6-22 September 2000, confirmed that among the 26 loan covenants, three were still pending or
not complied with, two were partially complied with, and all the others had been implemented.
The covenants implemented included, among others, corporatization of ONGC, creation of a
Directorate General of Hydrocarbons to provide a level playing field for private sector,
introduction of a New Exploration Licensing Policy, phased dismantling of the administered price
mechanism, and establishment of the common carrier company Petronet. As a result, the
general regulatory and business environment has undoubtedly grown much more market
oriented.
                                                iii


         However, the Program suffered from a number of failed assumptions, which were
partially responsible for the fact that a key covenant was not achieved. First, the time-bound
target of divesting 20 percent Government equity in ONGC failed to take into account the scale
and complexities of the divestment and necessary regulatory and market conditions for the
divestiture. Second, the Program's heavy emphasis on divestment, as a means to raise
additional capital and enhance management efficiency, was very uncertain as sales of
government shares at heavy discounts would have caused substantial financial losses for the
Government without really achieving much since the majority of the stake would have remained
with the Government even if the sales succeeded. Other alternatives such as forming joint
ventures, devising attractive policies to encourage foreign direct investment, and allowing more
management autonomy for the PSEs could have been more effective. Third, the Program's time
frame was too tight and no explicit consideration was given to proper sequencing of the reform
measures prescribed.

       In addition, other factors such as the Government's slow movement to market reforms
and reluctance to open up the market also played a role in the cancellation of the second
tranche. In this regard, the Government must accelerate the reform process and pursue private
and foreign direct investment with greater vigor and speed if it wants the Indian economy to
succeed in a region where competition is fierce for limited investment resources.

         In the area of exploration and development, the anticipated competition from the private
sector is yet to be realized with the PSEs, notably ONGC and Oil India Limited, still dominating
activity. Major foreign oil companies have been reluctant to make large investments in this
inherently risky business due to the administered prices and the difficulties in obtaining
marketing rights. Some believe that the multinational oil companies may hold the key for
acceleration of successful exploration due to their better resources and technology in certain
key areas, such as deep water exploration. The proportion of crude oil production from private
or joint ventures under production-sharing contracts remains insignificant, e.g., 4 million out of
37 million metric tons in FY1999/2000. Total private sector investment in exploration is also far
from the program target of $5.2 billion. The production of domestic crude oil remained largely
stagnant over the program period. Consumption/demand, on the other hand, was continually on
an upward trend with the oil self-sufficiency rate reduced to 37 percent in FY1998/99, much
lower than the targeted 45 percent. Recent high crude oil prices have once again brought
urgency to the sector's reforms as oil imports continue to drain the country's foreign currency
reserve and the deficit on the oil pool accounts (a cross-subsidy mechanism) deficit has
reached a very high level.

        The situation in the refining sector is somewhat better. Since the beginning of the
Program, a total of 12 refineries have been approved, five for operation by the private sector, six
by joint ventures, and one by the public sector. However, all the prospective foreign companies
including Exxon, Shell, KPC, etc. withdrew from the initial agreement due to concerns over
marketing rights, administered prices, and anticipated refining overcapacity in the country. Only
two domestic private companies, Reliance Petroleum, Ltd. and Mangalore Refinery and
Petrochemicals, Ltd. are already in production.

        The operational efficiency of the PSEs in the sector significantly improved during the
program period. Exploration and production per capita productivity increased by 23 percent, and
that for refining by 45 percent during the period between FY1991/92 and FY1997/98. However,
between FY1993/94 and FY1998/99, the Indian economy's energy intensity, measured by
hydrocarbon (oil and gas) consumption per unit of gross domestic product, increased marginally
by 1.8 percent, signaling that the economy might not have become more energy efficient, even
                                              iv


after allowing for some natural fluctuation of data. Waste in energy consumption, particularly
that associated with illegal or overuse of subsidized fuels such as kerosene, diesel, and
liquefied petroleum gas, is still evident.

       In view of the foregoing, the OEM rated the Program as less than successful.
                                             I.       BACKGROUND



A.        Rationale


1.       The operational strategy for India of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) in much of the
1990s was to assist the Government, in its strive for industrialization, achieve increased
economic efficiency through support for structural reforms, promotion of competition, and private
sector participation. The Hydrocarbon Sector Program (HSP) Loan was consistent with this
strategy. It was also part of international donor efforts to support India to diffuse its balance of
payments (BOP) crisis caused by the drying-up of short-term credits and the surge of oil import
costs due to the sharp oil price increases caused by the Gulf crisis. The Government that took
office in June 1991 acted swiftly to avert the crisis and prevent default in payments. A program
of macroeconomic stabilization was set in place consisting of structural reforms to trade, and
market-oriented industrial and trade policy frameworks. The Government negotiated a standby
arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in October 1991 for $2.3 billion and a
Structural Adjustment Loan with the World Bank for $500 million.

2.     HSP targeted market-oriented reforms in the hydrocarbon sector because petroleum and
petroleum products accounted for a significant share of imports (22 percent in FY1990/91). The
reforms aimed to contain the country's dependence on oil imports by increasing domestic
production and promoting energy conservation through, among others, attracting private sector
investments as well as enhancing financial, technical, and managerial efficiencies.


B.        Formulation


3.      On 8 November 1990 a small-scale technical assistance (TA) grant was approved to
review the hydrocarbon sector operations in India.1 In January 1991, a policy dialogue between
the Government and ADB on hydrocarbon sector policy was held in the context of a Special
Assistance Project.2 A broad framework of HSP emerged during the consultation mission held
on 15-19 April 1991. The policy framework included sector reorganization, private sector
involvement in exploration and development, market-oriented hydrocarbon pricing, energy
conservation, and resource mobilization. Following a government request for a program loan to
support the reforms for the sector, a fact-finding mission was fielded in September 1991 to
assess the Government's proposal and to further discuss government policy actions and
strategies in the sector. Policy dialogues continued during the appraisal mission in November
1991 during which the content and timing of the policy reforms, and the implementation
arrangements of the proposed loan, were discussed. The Board approved the Program on
17 December 1991.

4.       The six-week period from loan appraisal to approval was a near record speed for a
program loan addressing such complex reform issues, notwithstanding the emergency-
assistance nature of the loan. Not surprisingly, many of the design problems revealed later are
partially attributable to the hastened program preparation process. The Government, which was
strongly motivated to push through market-oriented reforms as well as in urgent need of a cash
injection, also appeared to have underestimated the complexities of implementing the program
measures.


C.        Objectives and Scope at Appraisal


5.     HSP aimed to maintain the share of oil imports in total oil consumption at the 1991 level,
as well as to support the Government's overall economic policies of macro-stabilization and
increased use of market-based instruments in allocating resources. HSP covered five major
areas that together aimed at complementing the Government's drive to improve the sector's
production potential and efficiency:

         (i)     undertaking sectoral adjustment through a program comprising appropriate policy
                 and instrument reforms and increased investment over the medium-term;
         (ii)    encouraging private sector participation in the oil and gas sectors through joint
                 ventures, leasing, contracting, build-operate-transfer, and other schemes;
         (iii)   mobilizing resources for financing medium-term investment in the sector involving
                 greater external cofinancing and raising additional private sector resources;
         (iv)    improving the operational and financial efficiency of public sector organizations
                 engaged in oil and gas exploration and development, through greater managerial
                 autonomy, decentralization, and divestment; and
         (v)     promoting increased energy efficiency and conservation through promotion of
                 appropriate pricing and related policies.

6.      The policy matrix under HSP covered 26 policy measures. Of these, 20 were to be
implemented prior to the release of the second tranche and six before the end of the program
period.


D.        Financing Arrangements


7.     The loan in an amount of $250 million was from ADB's ordinary capital resources, to be
disbursed in two equal installments of $125 million. The release of the tranches was conditional
on the implementation of agreed measures. The loan proceeds were to be utilized by the
Government to finance the foreign exchange costs of eligible imports. HSP was also cofinanced
by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF) with a loan of $250 million
equivalent. To support the Program, two TA grants totaling $600,000 were provided.3

    TA 1645-IND: Examination of Public Sector Oil Refining, Distribution and Marketing Activities, for $200,000,
    approved on 2 January 1992; and TA 1646-IND: Promotion of Private Sector Investment in Downstream Activities,
    for $400,000, approved on 2 January 1992.

E.     Donor Coordination


8.      ADB actively coordinated with the other donors, IMF, and the World Bank, who agreed
that efficiency in the sector needed to be improved; they supported ADB's proposed program.
While ADB cancelled the second tranche of the loan as the Government could not fulfill a loan
covenant regarding divesting the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), OECF released its
second tranche, after obtaining a "no objection" from ADB, on the basis that the Government
was committed to divestment but the actual completion of the divestiture was contingent upon
market conditions. Similarly, IMF had also stipulated several conditions while granting
emergency assistance to India, and considered that India had met all the major conditions
satisfactorily and waived, what it considered to be, minor deviations.

F.     Program Completion Report


9.      The loan was closed on 18 September 1997. The program completion report (PCR) was
circulated on 30 September 1998. The PCR concluded that, although the second tranche of
$125 million was cancelled despite three extensions to the loan closing date, the Program could
take credit for a number of policy reforms, improvement in the regulatory environment, and the
foundation for market-oriented reforms. The PCR classified the Program as partially successful.
It further concluded that, had ADB not insisted on the full compliance of the divestment
covenant relating to ONGC and released the second tranche of $125 million, the Program would
have been considered successful. The PCR also concluded that the two accompanying TAs
achieved their objectives within budget.


G.     Evaluation


10.    This program performance audit report (PPAR) focuses on overall impact and design
aspects of the Program and presents the findings of the Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM)
which visited the country during the period 6-22 September 2000. The PPAR also presents an
assessment of the Program's effectiveness in achieving its objectives and in generating a
sustainable development impact.

11.    The PPAR is based on a review of the PCR, Report and Recommendation of the
President (RRP), and material in ADB files; and on discussions with staff at ADB, the Executing
Agencies, and other government agencies, and with representatives of aid agencies, research
organizations, and the private sector.


                  II.    IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS



A.     Effectiveness of Design


12.     While the majority of the 26 measures stipulated as loan covenants (Appendix 1) were
appropriate and served effectively to advance market-oriented reforms in the sector, others, as
will be argued below, were less appropriate and effective.


       1.     Divestment Target


13.    A loan covenant regarded as key by ADB was the divestiture by the Government of 20
percent of its equity in ONGC. This was considered essential to pave the way for privatization,
enhancing efficiency of the sector, and raising additional resources for the Government.
However, the target proved to be unrealistic relative to the size of the domestic capital market
and limited interest in the stock from prospective investors. At the time of formulation, no
                                                          5


analysis of market realities was made to judge whether this condition was practical, in spite of
the fact that the transactions were potentially worth billions of dollars.

14.     ONGC's authorized share capital, after it was converted into a company from a statutory
body under the Indian Companies Act as required by the Program, was Rs150 billion (about
$3.3 billion) comprising 15 billion shares with a face value of Rs10 each. Under the Program,
the Government attempted to divest its share in installments. The first was the sale of 2 percent
to domestic financial institutions in October 1994, at a Rs1,533 per share. With the earnings per
share for FY1994/95 standing at Rs58.1, the price/earnings ratio was 26.4:1 or the return was
only 3.7 percent for investors.4 This was followed by the sale of another 2 percent to ONGC
employees at Rs270 per share (after dilution of the original shares in the ratio of 3.08:1).5
Subsequently, according to the Government, when it tried to auction 35.6 million shares, the
response was insignificant (bids for only 192,310 shares were received). The Government
therefore consulted industry experts and was advised that such divestment should only be
attempted after full deregulation of the sector, including the dismantling the administered price
mechanism (APM), a proposition the Government accepted.

15.     The Government was, and is still, of the view that had it tried to sell 16 percent of its
equity to satisfy the remaining condition for the release of the second tranche of $125 million, it
would have suffered huge losses several times greater than the second tranche. The Ministry of
Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOPNG) still harbors strong negative sentiments about ADB's
decision to cancel the second tranche to such an extent that, initially, it refused to meet with the
OEM. The Government argued that such a sale would not have assisted in redressing the
Government's budget deficit situation as envisaged under the Program.


          2.       Reform Time Frame and Sequencing


16.     The Program envisaged the reform measures to be carried out within three years, which
proved to be over optimistic. The Program period was extended three times to six years. In
addition, the sequencing of related reform measures was not carefully thought through. With
hindsight, price liberalization for major petroleum products should have been made as a
prerequisite for divestment of ONGC as private investors demonstrated little interest in acquiring
ONGC shares as long as the prices of major petroleum products, i.e., gasoline, diesel,
kerosene, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were administered by the Government.


B.        Implementation of Policy and Institutional Measures


17.     The measures envisaged under the Program covered a wide range of areas, namely,
regulation, exploration and production, refining, transportation, distribution and marketing,
pricing, divestment, efficiency improvements, and indirectly, environmental impact in the
hydrocarbon sector. The policy matrix providing the summary of planned actions, the timetable

4
    The share price appeared to be too high relative to the returns, and though no evidence indicates that the
    Government was imposing these shares on the financial institutions, many of them are wholly or partially owned by
    the Government.
5
    In comparison, according to the Annual Report of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation for FY1999/2000, the share
    prices traded on the national stock exchange have averaged Rs200 per share and the earnings per share for
    FY1999/2000 was Rs25.45.
                                                          6


as envisaged during appraisal, and the implementation status at the time of the PCR and OEM,
is attached as Appendix 1. Appendix 2 provides background information on the major players in
the sector.


          1.       Regulation


18.     Under the Program, a Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) was established
under MOPNG in April 1993 to administer the regulatory functions hitherto carried out by
ONGC. DGH oversees exploration and production activities; develops data packages for areas
offered for exploration; provides technical advice to the Government on related issues,
particularly development, conservation, and reservoir management; and advises MOPNG on
maintaining oil-field safety and environmental standards.

19.     The establishment of DGH represented the first step to create a level playing field for the
public and private sectors. The public sector enterprises (PSEs)--ONGC and Oil India Ltd.
(OIL)--are required to compete on equal terms with the PSEs (para. 22). In addition, data on
exploration acreage on offer are now available to the private sector on the same basis as to the
public sector. 6

20.      Based on the recommendations under a subsequent ADB-financed TA7 for regulatory
framework for the gas industry, the Government had earlier initiated steps for creating an
autonomous gas regulatory body, which would operate in a transparent manner. However, the
initiative experienced some bureaucratic and procedural delays and now the Government is
considering the establishment of a single regulatory body for the entire hydrocarbon sector
because of the close linkages between oil and gas.


          2.       Exploration and Production


21.     Prior to the Program, the entire responsibility for oil and natural gas exploration and
development was vested with two PSEs, i.e., ONGC and OIL. However, government statistics
indicate that the private sector is becoming increasingly active in the development of new oil
and gas fields. Contracts have been signed with private firms under the Program for the
development of six medium-sized and 24 small fields. Under the New Exploration Licensing
Policy (NELP),8 which, according to the Government, is one of the most favorable in the world,
the Government in January 1999 invited bids for 48 blocks (10 onshore blocks, 26 shallow water
blocks, and 12 deep water blocks). By the bid closing date of 18 August 1999, 45 bids for 27
blocks were received, of which 25 blocks were awarded. Of the 25 blocks, three were awarded
to Enron and eight to a consortium of major domestic private sector corporations i.e., Tata and
Reliance.



6
    TA 2775-IND: Hydrocarbon Exploration and Production Database and Archive System, for $600,000, approved on
    3 April 1997, assisted the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons in designing a national archive of exploration and
    production database.
7
    TA 2008-IND: Regulatory Framework for the Gas Industry, for $600,000, approved on 7 December 1993.
8
    Under this policy, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and the Oil India Limited are offered the same fiscal and
    contract terms as private companies.
                                                7


22.     However, subsequent interviews with the World Bank and private sector representatives
revealed a somewhat less optimistic scenario. They stated that the interest of foreign
companies in exploration activities is greatly inhibited by two factors: (i) a perception that the
blocks open to bidding are generally those with higher risks, and (ii) a government requirement
of Rs20 billion or $435 million minimum investment in the sector before a company is granted
the right to market oil products in India.

23.     The production statistics also support the less optimistic view. Crude oil production from
existing wells decreased from 30.35 million metric tons (MMT) in FY1991/92 to 27.17 MMT in
FY1993/94. With the additional production by ONGC and production from the private sector and
joint ventures (about 4 MMT in FY1999/2000), the domestic production of crude oil in
FY1999/2000 increased to about 36.55 MMT. In comparison, the Program envisaged that crude
oil production would reach 45 MMT per annum by the end of the program period (1997) in order
to contain the import share at the 1991 level of 45 percent.
                                                        8



          3.      Refining


24.     Under the Program, domestic and foreign private firms were allowed to enter the oil-
refining sector in 1991. The Government has approved 12 new refineries­five for operation by
the private sector, six by joint ventures, and one by the public sector. Of these, two--Reliance
Petroleum, Ltd. and the Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, Ltd.--are already in operation
while three private firms have already withdrawn, and commissioning of the others has been
delayed. The current status of the private and joint venture refineries is given in Appendix 3.
Two principal causes for the withdrawal and delays in the implementation of the others were
the possibly overbuilt refining capacity in the country as anticipated by some industry analysts
and the preconditions for obtaining marketing rights.

25.    In a separate move not related to the Program to prepare the PSEs for greater
competition from the private sector, the Government recently announced a restructuring of the
oil sector whereby all standalone refineries in the public sector are to be converted into
subsidiaries of marketing PSEs. Bharat Petroleum Company (BPC) will buy out the entire
government stake in Cochin Refineries and it will take over Indo Burma Petroleum's stake in
Numaligarh Refinery in Assam. Meanwhile, market leader Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will buy
out the entire stake in both Bongaigon Refinery and Chennai Refinery. The detailed timetable
was not available at the time of the OEM.


          4.      Pipeline Transportation


26.     One of the major recommendations of a TA9 under the Program was related to the
establishment of an independent common carrier company which would own and operate all the
transport and storage facilities in the hydrocarbon sector to which all the stakeholders in the
sector would have open access. In line with this recommendation, Petronet India Ltd. was
established in 1998 as a financial holding company with the specific objective of rapidly
developing a national network of pipelines for transporting petroleum products to which all
producers in both the private and public sectors could have open access. Fifty percent of the
equity in Petronet is held by five PSEs, i.e., IOC, BPC, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPC),
the Gas Authority of India, Ltd., and ONGC (each with 10 percent). The remaining 50 percent is
held by financial institutions and private companies, with no individual entity holding more than
10 percent of the total.


          5.      Marketing and Distribution


27.     The Program stipulated that new refineries under private or joint venture ownership
would be allowed to market oil products. This covenant was only partially complied with since
the refineries have been permitted to market only minor products such as lubricants. The right to
market the top five petroleum products--gasoline, diesel, kerosene, LPG, and aviation turbine
fuel--is still held by four PSEs i.e., IOC, BPC, HPC, and Indo Burma Petroleum. Recently, the

9
    TA 1645-IND: Examination of Public Sector Oil Refining, Distribution and Marketing Activities, for $200,000,
    approved on 2 January 1992.
                                                            9


Government agreed to let private companies engage in retailing provided that they invested at
least Rs20 billion in the upstream sector. Only the Reliance Petroleum Refinery Ltd., a private
Indian company, has fulfilled this condition. The Government is expected to approve its request
to market its refinery products. The PSEs have developed extensive retail outlets, which new
entrants may have difficulty matching. Foreign companies have tried to get a slice of this market
through joint venture arrangements with PSEs, but have not been successful. As stated earlier,
this has been an effective barrier to entry for private investors in the upstream sector that view
the retail sector as a cushion against the inherently risky exploration and production activities.

28.     In the case of LPG, the Government introduced a parallel marketing system in February
1993 enabling private sector participation in bottling and retailing of LPG to industrial and
commercial consumers. Virtually all the major multinational oil and gas companies present in
India are confined to this market. However, the commercial and industrial segment of the LPG
market is relatively insignificant at approximately 0.5 MMT, compared with the household
segment of 5.5 MMT, which is still controlled by the top PSEs under APM (para. 30). Further,
with commercial and industrial consumers illegally tapping subsidized LPG from household
consumers, even this limited market available to private companies has been adversely
affected.


           6.       Pricing


29.     Prior to HSP, the pricing system was fully under government control, and was known as
the APM. At the heart of APM are the oil pool accounts, created to insulate domestic crude oil
producers from volatile international crude oil prices and to provide for a mechanism for cross-
subsidizing certain petroleum products, such as kerosene and LPG for the household sector,
without government budgetary support.10 Under the Program, the Government started to align
petroleum prices with market prices, subject to maximum and minimum price constraints, from
the previous cost-plus formula, namely, cost of production plus a fixed profit margin. However, a
formal plan to phase out APM by 2002 was not announced until November 1997, two months
after the loan officially closed. Meanwhile, total subsidies have decreased from Rs186 billion in
1997 to Rs83.6 billion in 1999 (Table 1).

     Through the oil pool accounts, inflows from surcharges on the sales of petroleum products (mix of domestically
     produced and imported) and outflows for meeting the claims by domestic oil producers and refineries, are adjusted.
     When the world oil price is low, the surcharges will be high enough to meet the claims while still contributing a
     surplus to the fund, which will then be used to pay for the claims when the world crude price is high. Over an
     extended period of time, the pool accounts are supposed to balance.

30.    It should be noted that government revenues from customs and excise duties from oil
products far exceed subsidies. For instance, in FY1999/2000 (the latest year for which data are
available) the Government earned Rs222.3 billion from customs and excise duties whereas the
subsidies were only about Rs83.6 billion, i.e., about 38 percent of the revenues. In addition, the
state governments collect a substantial portion of their revenues from the hydrocarbon sector
through a sales tax.11 However, the prices of petroleum products in India are still some of the
lowest in the region, with the exception of oil- and gas-rich countries, as may be seen from
Table 2 below.12

         7.       Restructuring and Divestment


31.    As agreed under the Program, ONGC was changed from a statutory body to a
corporation under the Indian Companies Act in September 1993. However, most board directors
of the PSEs in the oil sector are government appointees, and some are appointed as board
members for multiple PSEs at the same time. As a result, although some progress has been
made compared to the situation prior to the Program, the PSEs are far from being granted full
autonomy.

32.     As stated earlier (para. 13), divestment of PSEs in the sector was given paramount
importance in the reform package prescribed by the Program. However, the Government was
only able to divest about 4 percent of ONGC to financial institutions and employees under the
Program. In 1999, after the loan closed, an additional 12 percent of government equity was sold
to other PSEs under a cross-shareholding scheme. Cross-shareholding, a common practice in
India, effectively consolidates the horizontal alliance of PSEs in the same sector and has drawn


11
   For example, in Maharashtra the sales tax as of 1 April 1999 was 13 percent on natural gas, 27 percent on
   gasoline, and 30 percent on diesel.
12
   The Government has raised the prices for major petroleum products shortly after the Operations Evaluation
   Mission.
                                                        11


much criticism as no real divestment has taken place and the stakes still remain with the
Government.

33.     Despite the difficulties with ONGC, the Government was more successful in divesting

34.     More recently, the move to divestment and privatization of PSEs appears to have gained
some momentum. A minister has been appointed in charge of divestment and a Department of
Divestment has been created. The Government presently owns 240 central PSEs, with a total
investment of Rs2,301 billion, over half of these incurring losses. Progress, though, has been
relatively slow in the hydrocarbon sector. Unlike nonprofitable PSEs, the companies in the
hydrocarbon sector have traditionally been regarded as "Navaratna" (Nine Gems) as they
contribute a significant share of government revenue. The total revenue from major oil PSEs in
FY1999/2000 was Rs289 billion, of which only little over Rs2.1 billion (or 0.7 percent) was in the
form of dividends and the rest as excise tax and duty. The implication is that the Government's
revenue will not be significantly reduced after divestment since only the dividend portion would
be relinquished. Aside from economics, there are security and strategic concerns as the oil
sector is viewed as the lifeline of the economy. All these factors have contributed to the very
slow motion of divestment.


C.     Management of the Program


35.    The EA for loan withdrawals was the Ministry of Finance while the EA for implementing
the Program and the TA was MOPNG. The dual EA structure has, to a certain extent, created
an incentive problem as MOPNG had no direct financial incentive to implement all the reform
measures on time and many measures such as the privatization of PSEs may even have been
viewed as harming its own short-term interests.

36.     Despite the incentive problem, monitoring of compliance with loan covenants was
successfully carried out by MOPNG. Dialogue during the program period, in the form of reports,
memos, and through other channels, between ADB and the Government was intense, resulting
in three extensions of the Program and ultimately the cancellation of the second tranche. During
the OEM, MOPNG pointed out the need for continuing such a policy dialogue, which would help
improve the understanding of each other's objectives and constraints, as well as development in
the sector.
                                                            13



37.     The Program included two TA grants (Footnote 3). The PCR reported that MOPNG did
not encounter any difficulties in recruiting two consulting firms under ADB's guidelines, and
rated the performance of the consultants as satisfactory. The OEM also confirmed that some of
the TA recommendations had been implemented, such as the establishment of a common
carrier company (Petronet) and market-oriented reforms.


D.         Assessment of Program Results



           1.       Choice of Indicators and Limitations


38.      In order to measure the Program's results, a set of indicators is identified against the
objectives that the Program set out to achieve. A caveat is in order that these indicators at best
may be used to measure the before and after program scenarios, which may not be conclusive
of the cause-effect relationship, or lack thereof, between the Program and the observed
differences. Multiple factors have contributed to the implementation of the policy and institutional
reforms in the hydrocarbon sector. What the OEM observed is the combined effects of various
initiatives taken by the Government14 and supported by the World Bank, IMF, and ADB.


           2.       Achievement of Objectives


39.     Containment of Share of Oil Imports to the 1991 Level. Table 5 shows that the crude
oil production increase envisaged by the Program did not materialize due to lack of exploratory
breakthroughs and the fact that the existing oil fields are running dry. Several factors have
contributed to this outcome, e.g., low investment, technological constraints of the PSEs, or
simply lack of prospective oil reserves. While the production level remained largely stagnant
over the program period, consumption and demand were continually on the increase and the
economy became more reliant on imported oil with the self-sufficiency rate reduced to 37 percent
in FY1998/99.

     In fact, during the OEM, several government officials repeatedly stressed that the reforms were implemented
     because of the Government's strong commitment, not because of the Hydrocarbon Sector Program
     conditionalities. They also pointed out that the sector reforms are being pursued vigorously despite the cancellation
     of the second tranche and closure of the loan.

40.     Undertaking Sectoral Adjustment through Policy and Instrumental Reforms. Most
of the loan covenants have been implemented or partially implemented, namely, conversion of
ONGC into a corporate entity (para. 14), creation of DGH aimed to provide a level playing field
for the private sector (para. 18), introduction of NELP (para. 21), phased dismantling of APM
(para. 29), and establishment of a common carrier company, Petronet (para. 26). As a result,
the general regulatory and business environment has undoubtedly grown much more market-
oriented.

41.       Encouraging Private Sector Participation. While the reforms have made the
hydrocarbon sector more conducive to private sector participation, the anticipated competition
from the private sector is yet to be realized. In the area of exploration and development, ONGC
and OIL do not face any major competition. Major foreign oil companies have been reluctant to
make large investments in this inherently risky venture due to the administered prices and the
difficulties in obtaining marketing rights. As a result, the proportion of crude oil production from
private or joint ventures under production-sharing contracts, as an indicator for measuring
private sector participation, remains insignificant, e.g., four out of 37 MMT in FY1999/2000
(Table 5).

42.     In the refining sector, the situation is somewhat better. Appendix 3 shows that private
and joint ventures dominated the 12 newly approved refineries. However, all the prospective
foreign companies including Exxon, Shell, KPC, etc. withdrew from the initial agreement due to
concerns over marketing rights, administered prices, and anticipated refining overcapacity in the
country. Only two domestic private companies, Reliance Petroleum, Ltd. and Mangalore
Refinery and Petrochemicals, Ltd., are already in production. Despite its new ultra-modern
refinery, Reliance alone will not be big enough to influence the market dominated by the PSEs.

43.     Mobilizing Resources for Medium-Term Investments. The RRP estimated that a total
of $10 billion would be needed in exploration and production to boost the production level, of
which $4.8 billion would come from PSEs and $5.2 billion from private sectors. Existing
government statistics on the amount of investment in the sector include only those by PSEs,
and no information is available on total private and joint venture investments. However, private
sector participation in exploration and production appears to be very limited and far from the
target level due to concerns over high risks and marketing rights. Compared with exploration,
refining received more substantial private investment, principally for one multibillion-dollar
project--Reliance's 27 MMT per annum ultra-modern refinery in Jamnagar.

44.     Improving Operational and Financial Efficiency of PSEs. Government statistics
indicate that the total numbers of employees in India in exploration and production, and in
refining have declined from 58,627 and 29,856 in FY1991/92 to 52,909 and 25,294 in
FY1998/99, respectively. Over this period, the domestic crude oil production increased slightly
from 30.35 MMT per annum to 33.86 MMT per annum, and the country's refinery throughput
increased from 54.254 MMT per annum to 66.672 MMT per annum. This resulted in a net per
capita productivity gain, as a measure of the sector's efficiency, of 23 percent for exploration
and production, and 45 percent for refining.
                                               15



45.     ONGC has been converted into a limited liability company and the PSEs have been
granted considerable autonomy in their operations, including forming joint ventures with
domestic and foreign private enterprises. Before 1997, there were 892 government "guidelines"
which controlled the operations of the PSEs. Of these, 696 guidelines were removed in 1997.
Also, in anticipation of the full dismantling of APM and industry deregulation (both scheduled to
be completed by 2002), the hydrocarbon sector PSEs are striving to restructure, modernize, and
streamline their technical, financial, and managerial operations and form strategic alliances with
suitable domestic and foreign partners. IOC, for example, is moving upstream by entering the
exploration and production of crude oil with the award of one onshore block under NELP. The
sector has taken several steps to keep abreast of international technical standards in refining,
e.g., Euro IV standards, and in storage and transportation.

46.     The gains in efficiency, albeit moderate, can hardly be attributed to divestment as thus
far divestment has not taken place in a substantial way. The reluctance to "sell the family
jewels", though unjustified, is very much evident (para. 35). Instead, the improvement is likely
the result of the Government's initiative to streamline its PSEs to prepare them for the greater
competition expected from the private sector. This was also evidenced by the recent
government announcement regarding upward integration of marketing PSEs through acquisition
of the standalone refineries in the public sector (para. 25).

47.     Promotion of Energy Conservation and Efficiency. Between FY1993/94 and
FY1998/99, India's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew from Rs7,813.13 billion to
Rs10,818.34 billion, while hydrocarbon (petroleum and natural gas) consumption increased
from 78.35 MMT oil equivalent to 110.41 MMT oil equivalent. This represents a marginal
increase in the economy's energy intensity of 1.8 percent, measured by hydrocarbon
consumption per unit of GDP. Even after allowing for data fluctuation, it is clear that the
economy did not become more energy efficient over the six-year period. Wasteful use of energy
is evident, particularly in areas associated with illegal or overconsumption of subsidized fuels
such as kerosene, diesel, and LPG. It is widely known that nonhousehold consumers use
subsidized kerosene and LPG intended for household users. The disproportionately large
number of diesel-powered and inefficient taxis is also partially the result of previous subsidies
on diesel (Table 1). Early dismantling of APM would obviously be desirable from the viewpoint
of energy conservation and efficiency.

48.     In sum, the degree to which the objectives have been achieved is characterized as a
mixture of both progress and inadequacy. Real but marginal progress has been made in
allowing competition, introducing of better technology, and making available resources to the
sector. However, more needs to be done in the areas of productivity and efficiency.


                                  III.    PROGRAM IMPACT


49.    A similar caveat as used earlier should also be applied in this section: it is virtually
impossible to pinpoint the exact impacts of this particular Program loan due to the multifaced
nature of the reform processes. Even in terms of donor support programs, ADB's contribution
was relatively modest.
                                                 16


A.       Macroeconomic Impact


50.       An immediate benefit expected from HSP was to assist the country in overcoming BOP
difficulties. The financial assistance provided by IMF, World Bank, ADB, and OECF helped the
Government meet India's import obligations and stabilize the economic situation. More
importantly, the cash injection also helped improve confidence of foreign investors, which led to
larger than expected inflows of foreign private capital in subsequent years. As a result, India
achieved macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth. Real GDP growth increased
from 0.4 percent in FY1991/92 to 6.4 percent in FY1999/2000 (Table 6).

51.     However, while the BOP support clearly succeeded, private sector participation in the
hydrocarbon sector did not materialize enough to accelerate exploration and development. For
much of the 1990s, the increasing dependence on imported crude oil did not put undue
pressure on India's BOP position. The surge in exports and the weak crude oil price were more
than sufficient to cover the import bill such that the foreign exchange reserve reached a high of
$38 billion (equivalent to 7.6 months of imports) at the end of FY1999/2000 (March 2000). The
current account deficit was at its lowest in the period under discussion at 0.5 percent of GDP in
FY1993/94 (Table 6).

52.      The recovery may have led the Government to become complacent about the urgency to
reduce the oil import dependency. As such, recent crude oil price increases have caught the
Government by surprise. If the crude oil prices average $30 per barrel during the rest of the
financial year, the total oil import bill for FY2000/2001 will double from FY1999/2000 level to $20
billion. This will threaten to drain the country's foreign currency reserve, which had already
declined to $32.7 billion by August 2000. The surging oil imports have also widened the year-
on-year trade deficit by $300 million so far and put more pressure on the rupee, which has
dropped by 3.5 percent against the dollar since April 2000 as of November 2000.

53.     Another key indicator in this regard is the oil pool accounts deficit. Table 6 indicates that
it reached Rs150 billion in FY1999/2000 and is likely to reach Rs236 billion ($5.1 billion) in
FY2000/2001. The Government has also recently announced that it will raise the price of
gasoline, kerosene, LPG, diesel, and aviation fuel to reduce the widening oil pool deficit.

    The OEM's estimate based on published information and interviews. The figure for FY2000/2001 is likely to reach
    Rs236 billion.



B.        Social Impact


54.     The Program did not aim for any specific social impact. However, it supported
macroeconomic stability and sustained economic development that would potentially benefit all
sectors of society. The positive impacts of macroeconomic stability may have been particularly
well received by the poor as they would be most vulnerable to high inflation. On the other hand,
the removal of subsidies on petroleum products like kerosene and LPG for household use, an
important component of the market-oriented reforms, would, in the near term at least, adversely
affect the poor. However, on several occasions, the OEM learned that the subsidized fuels often
do not reach poor households for which they are intended due to problems with the distribution
chain, and it is often comparatively wealthy people who benefit more from the subsidy.


C.        Institutional Impact


55.     The policy and institutional reforms had a positive impact on the institutions in the
hydrocarbon sector. The creation of DGH was instrumental in attracting foreign and domestic
private investment in the upstream sector. PSEs now enjoy considerable autonomy in their
operations as a result of the policy reforms. Also, because their shares are traded on the
national stock exchange, there is now more transparency in their financial reporting
requirements compared with when they were wholly under government ownership and control.


D.        Environmental Impact


56.     The hydrocarbon sector's operations have strong environmental implications through
both the production and consumption of its products. The environment was not directly
considered by HSP at its design stage. However, energy conservation and improvement of
efficiency of the sector, two explicit goals of HSP, would have had indirect positive impacts on
the environment, even though these objectives were not fully achieved. In addition, one of the
key loan covenants of HSP was to dismantle APM and remove subsidies on petroleum
products. From the environmental point of view, subsidized diesel was probably responsible for
the disproportionately large number of diesel cars in major cities like Delhi and Mumbai. Diesel
engines without emission controls tend to emit much higher amounts of air pollutant, e.g.,
particulate, than gasoline-powered engines. To that extent, the removal of subsidies on diesel
since 1998 (Table 1) is beneficial for the environment, although many of the diesel-powered
taxis will remain in the fleet for a few more years to come. On the other hand, subsidies for
cooking gas and kerosene are perceived to be environmentally beneficial as these fuels have
led to widespread displacement of coal and wood for domestic cooking and heating. Therefore,
measures should be taken in the future to ensure that the complete removal of subsidies on
cooking gas and kerosene do not force households to switch back to coal or fuelwood.
                                                          18


E.         Sustainability


57.     It appears that the economy-wide privatization, pricing, and institutional reforms which
began in 1991 in India following the Gulf crisis have gained considerable momentum and
become increasingly irreversible. The Government has announced the details of a phased
dismantling of APM by 2002,15 it will face a major loss of credibility if it reverses this course.
Further, due to the deterioration of the public infrastructure like telecommunications, power, and
water, a public consensus is emerging that the private sector would do a better job than the
PSEs. This is evidenced by the fact that despite several changes in the political parties in power
at the center, the direction of reform has been maintained, albeit at different speeds.


                                   IV.      KEY ISSUES FOR THE FUTURE

formulation of program loans, which require ADB's attention in its future operations.

     As this report was being reviewed, the Government, sensing greater urgency for reform, just announced its intent
     to move up this date to 2001.
                                                19



A.     Issues Related to Sectoral Improvement


59.     HSP aimed to support the Government's market-oriented reforms in the hydrocarbon
sector with a clear objective containing the total share of oil imports in total oil consumption at
the 1991 level. Almost 10 years have elapsed and the gap between domestic production and
consumption is as wide as ever. Given the importance of the hydrocarbon sector to India's
economy and the highly volatile nature of the international oil market, it is imperative that the
country continues with deregulation and pricing reforms. India must pursue private sector
participation, particularly from foreign investments, with greater vigor and speed if it wants to
succeed in a region where there is much competition for limited investment resources.


B.     Issues Related to Program Loan Formulation


60.    Quick-Disbursing Loans vs. Long-Term and Complex Reforms. Like many other
program loans, HSP was designed for dual purposes: BOP support (to stabilize the economy)
and support for sectoral reforms. BOP support called for the quick disbursing of the loan,
whereas the reforms it stipulated needed a much longer time to accomplish. Future policy-
based lending may consider severing the link between short-term crisis management and
support for long-term market reforms.

61.      ADB-Imposed Reforms vs. ADB-Government Joint Initiatives. The Government had
initiated the market-oriented reforms before HSP began. One can argue that, even without the
Program, the Government would still have carried out the reforms and, therefore, that the real
value added of the Program was limited. However, the issue can be viewed from a different
angle: if the reforms were purely ADB's initiative, the chances of their success would have been
even smaller. A growing body of evidence, accumulated both within ADB and the international
development community at large points to the fact that the political commitment of governments
to reform is the fundamental reason for the success (or otherwise) of policy-based lending. To
that extent, future policy-based lending should continue seeking a partnership with governments
on their reform initiatives as this will increase the likelihood of their success or broaden the
scope of existing reforms, even though it poses technical difficulties for evaluating the value
added of the program, as evidenced in this case. This does not mean that ADB can play only a
passive role by financing the costs of the reforms, which is very important, but can assist the
Government in a variety of ways--including providing TA, preparing reform packages, offering
policy dialogues, and financing follow-up investment needs.

62.     Use of Loans vs. Implementation of Reforms. The EA for loan withdrawal was the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) while the EA for implementing the reform measures was MOPNG.
There was no direct financial incentive for MOPNG to implement all the prescribed measures on
schedule, as many reform measures could have hurt its own short-term interests. This should
have been a cause for concern. Future policy-based lending should explicitly take into account
proper incentives for all stakeholders through, for example, follow-up investments or other
measures.

63.   Market-Oriented Reforms vs. Poverty Reduction Goals. Market-oriented reforms are
a common feature of all program loans aimed at improving the economic efficiency of a sector
or an economy. While such efficiency improvement will eventually benefit all segments of
                                              20


society, some reform measures, such as the removal of fuel subsidies in this case, may hurt the
poor in the short term. Consequently, particular attention should be paid to assessing the
impacts of economic reforms on the poor when formulating future program loans and, whenever
                                                 21


necessary, measures should be taken to protect the poor from drastic negative impacts, e.g., by
allocation of a minimum amount of subsidized fuel oil to the poorest households when
necessary.

64.     Compliance with Loan Covenants vs. Achieving Program Goals. The decision to
cancel the second tranche was based on noncompliance with a loan covenant stipulating the
divestment of 20 percent of ONGC. However, even with the full compliance of this covenant at a
discounted price, it would have not led to better achievement of the program goals, e.g., raising
additional capital and improving accountability (paras. 15-16). Conversely, nominal divestment
was carried out through, for example, cross-shareholding among different PSEs, but it did little
to raise additional capital and increase private sector participation. Thus, in administering as
well as evaluating future program loans, more attention should be paid to assessing to what
extent the program objectives are achieved rather than on simply monitoring the compliance
status of covenants.


                                      V.      CONCLUSION



A.     Overall Performance


65.     Program Relevance, Appropriateness, and Sustainability. The market-oriented
policy and institutional reforms envisaged under HSP were highly relevant, timely, and most of
them were appropriate. However, the reforms aimed at improving the sector's efficiency do not
necessarily validate import substitution as the primary motivation of the Program. The issue of
the relative economic competitiveness of domestic crude oil production against imports was not
extensively addressed during the Program's formulation. Instead, a reduction in spending from a
limited amount of foreign currency available on oil imports and, more implicitly, long-term oil
supply security, were regarded as the primary rationale for the Program. Although currently high
world crude oil prices appear to reinforce the rationale, the long-term economic viability of
domestic oil production competing against imports remains to be seen. The OEM also observed
that many of the reform measures, including establishment of DGH, phased dismantling of
APM, and devising favorable policies and incentives to attract foreign investment in the sector,
have been or are being implemented. Many of the reform measures implemented, and indeed
the general (but slow) trend of greater economic liberalization are increasingly irreversible.

66.     Program Efficacy and Rating. Despite the positive observations, the OEM rates the
Program less than successful. Several factors have contributed to this assessment. First, as
stated earlier, it is inappropriate to attribute the new developments wholly to HSP. In fact, the
Government continued to press ahead with the reforms despite the cancellation of the second
tranche by ADB. Second, arguably the most important goal of the Program, i.e., to contain the
share of oil imports at the 1991 level of 45 percent, was not realized, as the present level of self-
sufficiency is only 37 percent. Third, the loan covenant of divesting 20 percent of Government
equity in ONGC was found to be not only unrealistic but also ineffective from the viewpoint of
achieving the Program's objectives. Lastly, a "less than successful" instead of an "unsuccessful"
rating reflects the substantial progress that has been made in market oriented-reforms with the
anticipation that greater progress will be made in the near future.

67.     Borrower and ADB Performance. Both MOF and MOPNG registered satisfactory
performance in terms of administering the Program and monitoring progress. MOPNG, despite
several changes of government and the Program's lack of explicit consideration for its financial
incentive, demonstrated commitment to implementing the reform measures stipulated by the
Program. However, ADB's performance was deemed less than satisfactory on several fronts.
The Program was not well conceived, despite the fact that the broad framework was consistent
with ADB's country operating strategy, and the loan preparation was rushed. As a result, the
chances of a successful Program were compromised by the various design deficiencies. The
problems were further aggravated by the inflexible manner in which implementation was
handled.


B.     Lessons Learned


68.     Realistic Goals Based on In-Depth Sector Analysis. Success of program loans
depends on the formulation of realistic policy and institutional reforms. For HSP, the target of 20
percent divestment of the Government's equity in ONGC was unrealistic. No analysis was
conducted regarding what regulatory and market preconditions for such a large and complex
divestment should take place without jeopardizing shareholder value. The RRP's analysis on
program risks did not even mention that potentially poor market response could adversely affect
compliance. In addition, the target for additional domestic crude oil production was unrealistic as
it ignored the fact that the investments alone were no guarantee of finding and producing oil.

69.     Flexibility in Loan Conditions. ADB sent mixed signals to the Government when it
allowed OECF to release the second tranche while canceling its own second tranche. In the
implementation of program loans, ADB should adopt a flexible approach. Flexibility and
willingness to adapt will be a crucial factor for the success of ADB's future operations in India.

                                                                          conservation of energy. In addition, various
                                                                          measures have been undertaken including
                                                                          introduction of new technologies by the refineries
                                                                          to conserve energy.

                             HYDROCARBON SECTOR IN INDIA

1.     The hydrocarbon sector in India is presently undergoing profound changes that may
have far-reaching impacts on the sector's long-term performance. The following is a snapshot
overview of the sector covering major players, and the regulatory and economic environment in
which they operate, as of the Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM) period 5 to 23 September
2000. As the Government's efforts in market-oriented reforms deepen, the roles of various
players in the sector may vary.

A.     Government Agencies with Responsibility for the Sector

2.      The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOPNG) annual report defines its mandate
as "The Ministry is concerned with exploration and production of oil and natural gas, and
refining, distribution and marketing, import, export and conservation of petroleum product." At
present, MOPNG plays a central role in all key aspects of the sectors policy and strategic
decision making, as well as in some operational issues. As market reforms deepen, it is
expected that MOPNG may gradually withdraw from its day-to-day involvement in business
decision making and focus more on its supervisory and regulatory responsibilities

       1.      Oil Industry Development Board

3.      The Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB) was created in 1975 under Oil Industry
(Development) Act, 1974. As a financing arm of MOPNG, its primary objective is to render
financial and other assistance for promotion of all such measures that are conducive to the
development of the oil industry. The main functions of OIDB are to provide concessional loans
for high-risk exploration and grant assistance for research and development (R&D) in the
hydrocarbon sector. This includes:

       (i)     advancing loans to oil industrial companies;
       (ii)    disbursing loans and grants for the implementation of research and development
               programs conducive to the development of the oil industry;
       (iii)   refinancing oil industrial loans granted by the oil companies to industrial units;
               and
       (iv)    funding expenditure of various study groups, consultancy cells, scientific advisory
               committees, task forces, project monitoring cells, etc.

4.    OIDB has received Rs90.2 billion from the cess levied and collected by the Government
on domestic crude oil. The targeted recipients of OIDB funding have been predominantly oil and
gas public sector enterprises (PSEs). The significance of OIDB is somewhat uncertain amid the
ongoing sectoral reforms, anticipated greater private sector participation, and greater
competition from commercial financial institutions.

       2.      Directorate General of Hydrocarbons

5.      The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) was established in April 1993 as an
advisory body to MOPNG in matters relating to oil exploration and development, and to
assemble and integrate all data pertinent to the concessional areas leased for oil-and-gas
related activities. It advises the Government on the offering of areas for exploration as well as
on matters relating to relinquishing of areas, reviews the adequacy of exploration and
development programs, and advises the Government on oilfield safety and environmental
issues. The establishment of DGH was stipulated as one of the key loan covenants of the
                                                26                              Appendix 2, page 2


hydrocarbon sector program on institutional and regulatory framework reform which will set the
stage for creating a level playing field for all players in exploration and production, public or
private, foreign, or domestic.

6.      The establishment of DGH has created this more level playing field as far as the public
and private sectors are concerned. Under the new exploration-licensing scheme, the Oil and
Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL) are required to compete on equal
terms with private parties. In addition, data on exploration acreage on offer are now available to
the private sector on the same basis as to the public sector. At the time of the OEM, five blocks
had been opened for bidding under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP). They consist
of a cross-section of high-risk and low-risk fields.

       3.       Oil Coordination Committee and Oil Pricing

7.     The Oil Coordination Committee (OCC) was set up on 14 July 1975 through a
Government of India Resolution on the recommendation of the Interim Report of the Oil Prices
Committee (OPC). The secretary, MOPNG, is the Chairman of OCC, and the committee
comprises an additional secretary, joint secretaries, and a financial adviser of MOPNG, chief
executives of oil companies, and the executive director of the Oil Industry Safety Directorate.
The day-to-day functions are handled by the OCC secretariat under the executive director of
OCC.

8.     The main functions of OCC are as follows:

       (i)      monitoring the performance of the oil industry to achieve optimality;
       (ii)     preparing estimates for supply/demand and import plans;
       (iii)    assisting MOPNG in the preparation of Oil Economy Budget (OEB);
       (iv)     coordinating supply of crude oil to the refineries;
       (v)      operating and maintaining pool accounts;
       (vi)     coordinating major marketing activities of the oil industry;
       (vii)    coordinating with various government departments/agencies to facilitate
                coordination with the railways on optimizing tank wagon movements and the
                movements of petroleum products, etc.; and
       (viii)   assisting MOPNG in the management of crisis and special situations such as
                strikes, floods, elections, etc., for uninterrupted supplies of petroleum products.

9.      The pricing, subsidy, and tariff levels are administered by OCC through a mechanism
called the oil industry pool accounts. Under such a mechanism, inflows from collection of
surcharges on the sale of petroleum products and outflows for meeting the claims for variation
in the elements included in the price build-up are adjusted. The difference between inflows and
outflows represents the surplus or deficit position of the pool accounts. The main objectives of
the pool accounts are to:

       (i)      maintain stable and uniform prices throughout the country in recognition of the
                need to import crude oil for refineries and for finished products to meet the deficit
                in domestic production; and
       (ii)     provide subsidies or cross-subsidies on some petroleum products.

10.   Oil pool accounts are supposed to balance over a period of time and there is no need for
government budgetary support. The pool accounts were generating a surplus up to FY1988/89.
                                              27                                 Appendix 2, page 3


However, due to high crude oil prices, the accounts deficit by the end of FY2000/01 is expected
to reach Rs150 billion.

11.     The Government took steps to align the petroleum prices with open market prices and
gradually phase out administered price mechanism (APM). In November 1997, it announced the
details of a phased dismantling program of APM and of the duty structure from April 1998 until
2002 as follows:

       (i)     cost-plus formula for indigenous crude oil producers has been withdrawn and
               gradual import parity established, currently standing at 82 percent of imported
               crude oil prices subject to ceiling and floor constraints;
       (ii)    retention pricing for all refineries has been abolished (except refinery gate prices
               of controlled products--gasoline, diesel oil, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas
               (LPG), and aviation fuel--which are fixed in accordance with the principles of
               adjusted import parity price for the existing refineries during the transition period);
       (iii)   consumer prices of gasoline, diesel oil, kerosene, aviation fuel and LPG (for
               domestic use) will continue to be administered; and
       (iv)    prices of other petroleum products like naphtha, fuel oil, bitumen, and paraffin
               wax have been decontrolled since 1 April 1998.

B.     Exploration and Production

12.    Presently, two major PSEs in exploration and production are ONGC and OIL, which
together provided little less than 33 million metric tons (MMT) of crude oil in FY1999/FY2000,
with ONGC's share estimated at over 29 MMT. Additionally, private and joint venture companies
produced approximately 4 MMT, bringing the total to 36.55 MMT for the year.

13.      The net production of natural gas was 27.428 billion cubic meters (m3), including 2.87
billion m3 from private and joint venture companies, in FY1999/2000, a marked increase from
18 billion m3 in FY1991/1992 at the start of HSP.

       1.      Oil and Natural Gas Corporation

14.      ONGC was formed by an Act of Parliament to take over the activities of the Oil and
Natural Gas Directorate set up by the Government in 1956. It was a statutory body until it was
corporatized under HSP in September 1993. As the country's dominant upstream oil company,
it carries out geological and geophysical surveys, exploratory drilling, development drilling, and
exploitation of hydrocarbon resources. Until recently, ONGC had the virtual monopoly of all
offshore and most onshore exploration and production activities.

15.     Presently ONGC has about 40,000 employees, down from 47,000 at the beginning of
HSP in 1991. It is envisaged that the total workforce will be further reduced to 35,000 in five
years through voluntary retirement. The company is in a relatively healthy financial situation. In
FY1998/99, the company produced 27.55 MMT crude oil and 23.97 billion m3 natural gas for a
net profit (after tax) of Rs27.545 billion.

16.      Despite the relatively healthy financial picture, the future of ONGC's production
capacities allows for no optimism. Its existing oil fields are running dry, and its exploration
activities have made no major findings of oil and gas fields. As such, ONGC, and the entire
upstream exploration and production system, has been targeted by MOPNG as a priority area
for attracting foreign direct investment and technological collaboration, particularly in the areas
                                              28                               Appendix 2, page 4


of deep-sea exploration and technology related to prolonging the productive lives of existing
wells.

17.     Under the NELP (which the Government claims is one of the most favorable in the
world), a total of 48 blocks have been offered. By the bid closing date of 18 August 1999, a total
of 45 bids were received from both foreign and Indian companies including public sector
undertakings, of which 25 blocks were awarded, including three to Enron and eight to a
consortium formed by major domestic private corporations, i.e., Tata and Reliance. In addition,
ONGC is actively seeking foreign partners for the exploration of the six blocks that it has been
awarded. A total of 17 foreign firms expressed interest including Total of France and BG
International of the United Kingdom. In addition to collaborating with foreign companies in
domestic exploration and production, ONGC is also looking to provide drilling services to secure
production contracts overseas including Bangladesh and Oman. ONGC has established ONGC
Videsh Limited (OVL), a wholly subsidiary, to enter into joint ventures for exploration and
production in other countries. OVL, in partnership with BP-Amoco and Statoil, has already
discovered offshore gas in Viet Nam.

18.     The latest international crude oil price increases have generally weighed in favor of the
upstream companies like ONGC. This is because prices of the domestically produced crude
have been pegged to international prices on an increasing-proportion basis since 1998 (when
the old cost-plus pricing formula was abolished). The proportion started at 75 percent and has
been increasing gradually to the present 82.5 percent of the international crude oil price, subject
to a ceiling of $25 per barrel. The ceiling crude oil price is imposed to curtail excessive costs to
the downstream companies and consumers during severe international crude oil price
increases, and to compensate for the floor prices when there is a sharp decrease in prices.

       2.      Oil India Limited

19.      OIL's origins date back to the time when oil was first discovered in Assam in 1889. The
Government of India, which was a joint venture partner with Burmah Oil Company, took over the
latter's shareholding in full in 1981. As with ONGC, although on a much smaller scale, OIL's
primary activities are exploration, production, and transportation of hydrocarbons, with a rough
breakdown of sales as follows: crude oil (90 percent), natural gas (5 percent), transportation
charges (3 percent), and LPG (2 percent). OIL's operations are very much confined to northern
India including Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, the Mahanadi basin, and several
offshore areas.

C.     Private and Joint Venture Companies

20.    At present, private and joint venture companies contribute approximately 4 MMT to total
domestic production of crude oil (about the same as OIL's production). Most of these private
companies, including ESSAR, HOEC, Okland, and Shell are operating under production sharing
contracts (PSCs) with ONGC operating on existing known oil fields. The proportion of crude oil
production from private companies and joint ventures is expected to rise in the coming years as
more and more private (domestic and foreign) companies are awarded blocks for exploration
under the Government's NELP.

D.     Refining

21.      The refining subsector has been delicensed since 1998. The Government has opened
oil refining to the domestic and foreign private sector. During the Program, the Government
                                                                              Appendix 2, page 5
                                             29
approved 12 new refineries. Of these, two--Reliance Petroleum Refinery Ltd. and the
Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, Ltd.--are already in production while three private
firms have already withdrawn.

22.    With the commissioning of several large modern refineries, Indian's refining capacities
have increased from 69.14 MMT per annum as of 4 January of 1999 to 109.04 MMT per annum
as of 1 January 2000, making the country almost self-sufficient in the refining sector. Total
capacity is expected to further increase to 126 MMT per annum by the end of the Ninth Plan
(1997-2002). There are currently 17 refineries in the country, of which seven are owned by the
Indian Oil Corporation, Ltd.

       1.      Indian Oil Corporation Limited

23.     The Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) was established on 1 September 1964 with
the merger of Indian Refineries Ltd. and the Indian Oil Company Limited with the main objective
of coordinating and controlling the refining and distribution activities of these two oil companies
effectively.

24.     With a total workforce of 32,000, IOCL is the largest commercial undertaking and only
Fortune 500 company in India. IOCL is both a refining and marketing company. With seven
refineries and 35.6 MMT per annum combined capacity, its refining capacity accounts for
roughly one third of India's total. It also owns and operates a 6,543 km network of pipelines with
an installed capacity of 43.45 MMT per annum.

25.     The refineries of IOCL achieved a crude throughput of 30.36 MMT during FY1998/99.
Against the contracted target of 31.80 MMT for FY1999/2000, the throughput achieved up to
December 1999 was 23.86 MMT. In FY1998/99, IOCL achieved a turnover of Rs6,943 billion for
an after-tax profit of Rs221 billion.

       2.      Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited

26.     The Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) is a PSE (with the Government
holding 51.06 percent) and the second largest integrated oil company in India. It has two
refineries producing a variety of petroleum products--fuels, lubricants and specialty products,
one in Mumbai (on the west coast) having a capacity of 5.5 MMT per annum and the other in
Visakhapatnam (on the east coast) with a capacity of 4.5 MMT per annum (being expanded to
7.5 MMT per annum). HPCL also operates the only joint venture refinery in the country in
association with the Aditya Birla Group of Companies (an Indian private conglomerate).

27.    During FY1998/99, the two refineries of HPCL achieved a combined crude oil throughput
of 9.07 MMT, or a little less than one third of IOCL's level. The sales turnover increased to
Rs2,599.46 billion in FY1998/99 for a net profit of Rs90 billion.

       3.      Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited

28.     The Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) is an integrated oil company in the
downstream sector engaged in refining crude oil and marketing petroleum products. It has also
diversified into the manufacture and marketing of petrochemical feedstocks. The Government's
holding in BPCL is 66.2 percent.
                                                 30                               Appendix 2, page 6


29.      During FY1998/99, BPCL oil refinery achieved a throughput of 8.94 MMT. The sales
turnover in FY1998/99 was Rs2,565 billion, compared with Rs2,070 billion the year before, for a
profit after tax of Rs70 billion.

E.      Standalone Refineries

30.    Major standalone refineries in India include Cochin Refineries, Chennai Refineries,
Mangalore Refineries, and Reliance Petroleum. The crude oil throughput for these companies
for FY1999/2000 were 7.8 MMT, 7.0 MMT, 5.2 MMT, and 9.9 MMT, respectively.

31.     In a move to pave the way for the PSEs to meet anticipated competition, the
Government has recently announced consolidation of the oil sector whereby all the standalone
refineries in the public sector will be converted into subsidiaries of larger PSEs. While BPCL will
buy out the entire government stake in Cochin Refineries, it will take over Indo Burma
Petroleum's (IBP) stake in Numaligarh Refinery in Assam. Market leader IOCL will buy out the
entire stake in both Bongaigaon Refinery and Chennai Refinery. IOCL and BPCL are expected
to spend nearly Rs20 billion to acquire stakes in these oil refineries.

32.     The rise of Reliance Petroleum represents major progress in private sector participation
in the sector. Through vertical integration, Reliance has gradually moved upstream from textile
to petrochemical, to refineries and to oil exploration and production. With its recently
commissioned ultra modern refining facility with an installed capacity of 27 MMT per annum,
Reliance will be a major force in the refining sector.

F.      Marketing

33.      Unlike the refining sector, the retail sector is virtually controlled by four PSEs, i.e., IOCL,
BPCL, HPCL, and IBP, which have, over the years, developed an extensive network of storage,
transportation, and retail outlets nationwide. IOCL currently controls over 54 percent of the
market with BPCL and HPCL controlling approximately 20 percent each. Any company, foreign
or domestic, that wishes to engage in marketing activities has to invest a minimum of Rs20
billion in oil and gas infrastructure. The first domestic private company that met this criterion was
Reliance Petroleum Refinery Ltd., which is currently applying for, and is expected to obtain,
rights to market petroleum products.

34.      The existing natural monopoly, as well as the requirement of investment in upstream
activities, has served to deter some potential investors in the hydrocarbon sector as a whole.
Very few risk-averse foreign oil and gas companies are willing to invest millions of dollars in
exploration and refineries without first being guaranteed marketing rights.

G.     Gas Distribution and Marketing

35.    The total net production and consumption of natural gas was 25.71 billion m3 for
FY1998/99. Prior to 1984, ONGC and OIL handled the production, transmission, and distribution
of natural gas. Since 1984, distribution and marketing have been largely taken over by Gas
Authority of India Limited (GAIL).

36.    Gas Authority of India Limited. The Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL), set up in
1984, is the largest natural gas transmission company in India. The company owns and
operates a network of over 4,000 km of pipelines. GAIL primarily targets large industrial and
commercial customers including those PSEs in the power and fertilizer industries for its natural
                                              31                              Appendix 2, page 7


gas. Total gas sales for FY1998/999 were 21 billion m3. GAIL also operates six natural gas
processing plants with an installed capacity to produce 961,000 tons of LPG per year.

H.     Private Sector Involvement in LPG

37.     At present, the total market size for LPG is about 6 MMT, of which approximately 5.5
MMT is sold to domestic households by four major PSEs, i.e., IOCL, GAIL, BPCL and HPCL, at
a subsidized price under APM. The remaining 0.5 MMT is sold to industrial and commercial
customers at market prices. As part of industry deregulation the Government has, since 1993,
allowed private sector participation in importing and retailing LPG to cater to this small segment
of the market. This has led to the establishment of a number of private sector units for importing
and marketing LPG and kerosene in the private sector. Most major multinational oil and gas
companies currently operating in India, including Shell, Caltex, ELF Gas, Mobil, and SHV, are
now limited to this small segment of the market.

I.     Oil Pipeline Transmission


38.     Petronet India Limited. Petronet India Ltd. was established in 1998 as a financial
holding company with the specific objective of rapidly developing a national network of pipelines
for transporting petroleum products to which all producers in the private and public sectors will
have open access. Half of the equity in the company is held by five PSEs including IOCL,
BPCL, and HPCL. The remaining 50 percent is held by financial institutions and private
companies, with no individual entity holding more than 10 percent of the total. The creation of
Petronet was in line with a key recommendation by TA 1645-IND for the creation of a new
independent common carrier company to manage all pipelines and associated terminals and
ensure open access by all oil companies.

39.    Individual pipeline projects are undertaken as joint ventures wherein Petronet holds
26 percent of the equity, oil companies and private companies up to 26 percent, while the
balance is held by financing institutions and other investors.

40.    Petronet has identified eight pipeline projects for implementation. Joint ventures for four
have been incorporated, of which, one (Vadinar-Kandla) has been completed and three are
under construction. Detailed feasibility studies for the other four projects are scheduled to be
completed in 2001.
