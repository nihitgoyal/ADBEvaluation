                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

       The investment loan approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1990 to the
Calcutta Electric Supply Company (CESC) Limited was for a transmission project that aimed to
achieve a more integrated system linking the power plants and substations in CESC's network.
The original project scope was limited to augmenting CESC's 132/33 kilovolt (kV) transmission
system. During implementation, an unexpected increase in the demand for electricity justified
expanding the project scope to also strengthen some of CESC's transmission and distribution at
lower voltage levels. The Project's rationale to help meet the increasing demand for electricity in
Calcutta (renamed Kolkata in 2001) was consistent with the Government's Eighth Plan
(FY1991­FY1995) to spur industrial growth across India and ADB's assistance strategy for
promoting and sustaining economic growth.

        Outputs under the original scope included (i) laying of four 132 kV underground
transmission cables, (ii) construction of two new 132 kV substations, and (iii) upgrading of four
existing 132 kV substations. Outputs for the expanded scope included (i) construction of an
additional 132 kV underground transmission cable, (ii) construction of nine new 33 kV
substations, and (iii) installation of a 33 kV power capacitor. The Project was formulated and
designed by CESC's in-house engineers and approved by India's Central Electric Authority.

        ADB's appraisal was completed in July 1990, and Investment 7058/Loan 1036-IND:
CESC Limited, for $17.8 million equivalent, in support of a total project cost of $91.6 million, was
approved on 4 October 1990. The ADB loan was to finance 61% of the estimated foreign
exchange cost. A loan for $20.0 million equivalent from the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) was to be used to finance the balance of the foreign exchange cost ($11.4 million) of
imported equipment and $8.6 million of the local currency cost. Expansion to the project scope
was approved in May 1994, and the total project cost was reestimated at $74.1 million. The
major reduction in US dollar terms was mainly attributable to favorable currency variations and
concessional import duties. CESC assumed responsibility for project implementation and for the
foreign exchange risk on its ADB and IFC loans.

       The Project was completed in June 1996, 15 months later than envisaged at appraisal.
The longer time taken was due entirely to the expansion in project scope. The original project
components were completed in December 1994, 3 months ahead of schedule. At $75.0 million,
the actual project cost was only 1% above the revised estimate.

        Construction of the new transmission lines and substations increased CESC's
transmission capacity by 423 megawatt. Without the Project, CESC's transmission and
distribution losses would have been about 4% higher. Voltage reliability across the 33 kV and
lower voltage transmission lines would have also been impaired, and CESC's capacity to switch
power sources to offset overloading and meet maintenance requirements would have been
inadequate.

        The Project is rated successful. Its rationale was relevant, and technical design
appropriate. Implementation was efficient, and the overall cost in US dollar terms was 18% less
than envisaged at appraisal, despite the major expansion in project scope. The Project enabled
CESC to meet transmission requirements for new generation units at the Southern and Budge
Budge power stations, thus helping eliminate a 15.0% supply deficit. The time-slice economic
internal rate of return of 12.1% attests to the economic viability of CESC's investments from
FY1990 to FY1996. The financial internal rate of return of 6.3% is close to the real weighted
average of capital.
                                                                                                v



         Detracting from a higher rating assessment, the financial statements of CESC reveal a
weakening financial status associated with high financial gearing and insufficient infusions of
equity capital. Delays since FY1995 in approving increases to the electricity tariff, and rising
transmission and distribution losses have also undermined CESC's financial performance. In
January 2002, CESC was forced to default on fully servicing its debt obligations to lenders.
Nevertheless, positive steps have been taken that collectively provide some optimism that
CESC can overcome its financial difficulties. A decision by the Supreme Court on 3 October
2002 to allow CESC to increase its electricity tariff has enabled CESC to recommence loan
servicing. A world-renowned investment bank has been engaged to advise on financial
restructuring. Issues surrounding the principles for approving electricity tariff adjustments were
clarified under the Supreme Court's judgment; this should lead to more timely future
adjustments. To reduce its transmission and distribution losses, CESC is implementing a
program for upgrading meters, installing capacitors, and taking legal action against electricity
theft. Complementing CESC's measures, the West Bengal Government has introduced harsh
penalties for theft, and improved court processing for enforcement. As a result of these efforts,
CESC's transmission and distribution losses decreased from 23.9% in FY2001 to 21.9% in
FY2002, and are expected to fall significantly in FY2003.

        The key lesson learned from the Project is that with a more comprehensive technical
evaluation and credit assessment at appraisal, the project scope necessary to achieve CESC's
performance targets could have been more reliably identified. This lesson and a few others from
the Operations Evaluation Mission's observations of CESC's operations are reflected in the
following recommendations:

       (i)     ADB should ensure more comprehensive appraisal when processing future
               private sector projects.
       (ii)    CESC should (a) consider restructuring and corporatizing its generation,
               transmission, and distribution so that the operations of each entity are
               independent with separate pricing and accountability for expenditures and
               revenues; and (b) make more use of bond and equity markets to meet
               investment requirements.
       (iii)   The West Bengal State Government should (a) restructure the power sector and
               introduce competition in the provision of power in Kolkata so that the role of the
               regulator is shifted away from price setting, and (b) provide CESC with legislative
               support and recovery mechanisms for dealing with outstanding customer ac counts.
                                              I.       BACKGROUND

A.        Rationale

1.      At the time of project conception, Calcutta 1 was experiencing shortfalls in the supply of
electricity. The Calcutta Electric Supply Company (CESC) Limited, which was licensed to
operate and expand the transmission and distribution network in the city, was finding it difficult
to raise funds in the domestic market to meet its growing investment needs.2 The transmission
network required higher voltages, additional lines from CESC's generation sources, and new
substations in areas with high load growth. The Project's rationale of helping meet the
increasing demand for electricity in Kolkata was consistent with the Government's Eighth Plan
(FY1991­FY1995) that supported industrial growth across India and the Asian Development
Bank's (ADB's) assistance strategy for promoting and sustaining economic growth. Prior to
release of the Eighth Plan, the Government of India, in recognition that economic growth was
being impeded by shortages of electricity supplied from public power utilities, encouraged the
private sector to undertake a more significant role in new investments.3

B.        Formulation

2.      The Project was formulated by CESC with a request to ADB in August 1989 for financial
assistance. ADB considered the Project to have merit. Following its approval by the Central
Electric Authority, fact-finding was undertaken in May 1990, followed by appraisal in July 1990.
ADB's loan of $17.8 million equivalent (drawn in various currencies) was approved on 4 October
1990. 4 The Borrower was CESC Limited, a public-listed company registered on the India and
London stock exchanges, in which 53% of the shares were owned by the private sector.5 ADB's
loan was secured by way of a shared mortgage over CESC's fixed assets.6 There was no
government guarantee.

3.     During construction of the Project in FY1993, there was an unexpected increase in the
demand for electricity from 881 megawatts (MW) to 967 MW.7 The increase justified an
expansion to the project scope to strengthen CESC's network at lower voltage levels (para. 6).
In addition to financing CESC's transmission and distribution network development, ADB
supported also CESC's generation program, through a second loan for 2 x 250 MW generator

    Because of the already high exposure of local finance institutions to CESC (47% of equity and 90% of outstanding
    debt), a policy was introduced by the Government of India restricting new lending by local finance institutions to a
    maximum of 40% of investment cost.

    With approval of the West Bengal State Government, CESC was permitted to augment the supply of power to its
    transmission and distribution network, in addition to power supplied from the West Bengal State Electricity Board.
    Approval was given for CESC to install (i) 2 x 67.5 megawatts (MW) new generator units at the Southern power
    station for commissioning in FY1991 and FY1992, and (ii) 2 x 250 MW new generator units at Budge Budge for
    commissioning from FY1995 in two phases.

December 1996.8

C.         Purpose and Outputs

4.      The project purpose was to augment CESC's transmission capacity so as to achieve a
more integrated system linking the power plants and substations in CESC's system. The initial
project scope was limited to augmenting CESC's 132 kilovolts (kV) transmission network with
links to two new substations and four existing load centers. With the surge in load demand in
FY1993, it became necessary to expand further CESC's 132 kV transmission network and
strengthen CESC's transmission and distribution at 33 kV, 11 kV, and 6 kV levels.

5.      The project outputs for the original scope included (i) laying four 132 kV underground
transmission cables between New Cossipore and East Kolkata, East Kolkata and Prinsep
Street, Prinsep Street and Park Lane, and Majerhat and Jadavpur substations; (ii) construction
of two new 132 kV substations at East Kolkata and Jadavpur; and (iii) upgrading of four existing
substations at Majerhat, New Cossipore, Park Lane, and Prinsep Street.

6.      The project outputs for the extended scope included (i) laying an additional 132 kV
underground transmission cable between Jadavpur and Kasba substations; (ii) transformers,
relay, and switchgear equipment for nine new 33/11/6 kV distribution stations 9 to cater for the
additional load demand; and (iii) installation of one 33 kV power capacitor at Kasba substation
to improve voltage reliability. Further details of the project outputs and expected impacts are in
Appendix 1.

D.         Cost, Financing, and Executing Arrangements

7.     As shown in Appendix 2, the total project cost was estimated at appraisal at
Rs1,575 million ($91.6 million), including a foreign exchange cost of Rs504 million
($29.2 million) and a local currency cost of Rs1,071 million ($62.4 million). ADB's loan of
$17.8 million equivalent was to be used to finance 61% of the foreign exchange cost related to
imported equipment, engineering services, and interest during construction. A loan for
$20.0 million equivalent from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) was to be used to
finance the balance of the foreign exchange cost ($11.4 million) for imported equipment and
$8.6 million of the local currency cost. The remaining part of the local currency cost was to be
funded by local finance institutions (Rs610 million, or $35.5 million) and CESC (Rs315 million,
or $18.3 million).

8.     In February 1994, when the need to extend the project scope became evident, the
revised estimate for the original scope was Rs1,528 million ($50.1 million). The major reduction
in US dollar terms was mainly attributable to favorable currency variations and concessional
import duties. The project scope expansion increased the estimated overall project cost to
Rs2,284 million ($74.1 million), which could still be financed within the funding arrangements

    6 December 1996. Following protracted delays in the adjustment of electricity tariffs, the validity period of the latter
    expired and the loan was subsequently cancelled on 31 October 2001.

    detailed assessment of load requirements, the proposed substations at Bally, Dumdum, and Park Circus were

envisaged at appraisal. CESC assumed the foreign exchange risk and responsibility for project
implementation. 10

E.      Completion and Self-Evaluation

9.      ADB's Project Completion Review Mission inspected the Project in October 1998.
Although no explicit rating was given, an assessment of generally successful11 could be inferred
from the project completion report (PCR) as all project components were found to have been
implemented satisfactorily and within budget. The performance of contractors was considered
good, and the Project was seen to have (i) enhanced load management and operating
efficiencies; (ii) reduced the risks of outages; and (iii) enabled power to be transferred from the
Southern and Budge Budge power stations which, in turn, reduced CESC's reliance on power
purchases from the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB). The Project's financial
internal rate of return (FIRR) and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) were recalculated at
9.2% and 15.8%, respectively, close to the appraisal estimates of 8.9% and 15.9%. Against
these success factors, some deterioration in CESC's financial strength was observed, and
attributed to a dispute with the West Bengal State Government (WBSG), which had not
approved CESC's application to increase tariffs. The dispute was resolved in October 1998.
With a 25.4% approved tariff increase, the financial strength of CESC was expected to be
restored.

10.     The PCR identified several positive lessons learned as reasons for the satisfactory
implementation of the Project: (i) the role of ADB in working closely with CESC, (ii) the
competence of CESC as an experienced operator, and (iii) the satisfactory legal and regulatory
framework under which CESC operated. Attention was drawn to the need to look seriously at
the inefficiencies in transmission and distribution due to high power losses, which were affecting
the creditworthiness and the capacity of private sector projects to raise commercial finance.

11.     The PCR reliably evaluated project implementation, but in the absence of a technical
advisor, could not provide an assessment of the technical effectiveness of the Project. The
broader development impacts of the Project were also not assessed, and evaluation of CESC's
financial performance and outlook for the future proved unrealistic.

F.      Operations Evaluation

12.     This project performance audit report (PPAR) examines the findings of the PCR and
reassesses the economic, financial, and operating performance of the Project. Special attention
is given to assessing the achievement of project purpose, intended developments from the
Project, sufficiency of technical design for meeting load growth, financial performance of CESC,
and sufficiency of its initiatives to contain system losses. Also assessed are recovery
mechanisms on loan and customer debt, planning, environmental issues, and the capacity for
private sector participation to meet Kolkata's future power expansion needs. The PPAR reflects
the findings of an Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM) that visited Kolkata in November 2002;
a review of the PCR, appraisal report, material in ADB files, and 3 years of additional
operational data; CESC's responses to the OEM's questionnaire; and discussions with ADB
staff, CESC's senior management, and electricity consumers at Jadavpur. Copies of the draft
PPAR were provided to WBSG, CESC, and ADB departments concerned for review, and their
comments were considered in finalizing the PPAR.

10
   At appraisal, CESC's exposure to foreign exchange risk on its foreign loans was reported as negligible. CESC's
   foreign exchange risk on the ADB and IFC loans was considered manageable and within acceptable bounds for
   recovery through the electricity tariff.

                           II.    PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION PERFORMANCE

     A.      Formulation and Design

     13.       Formulation of the Project was influenced by (i) the need for additional power to support
     industrial growth, (ii) ADB's assistance strategy for promoting and sustaining economic growth,
     (iii) the viability of CESC's proposal for achieving a cost-effective and technically efficient
     transmission network, and (iv) the apparent shortage of financing options available to CESC. At
     appraisal, ADB accepted CESC's technical proposal and reassessed the financial and
     economic viability of the Project based on CESC's aggregate investment program for the period
     FY1991­FY1995. Final technical specifications and costings were subject to detailed design
     during implementation, using CESC's in-house technical expertise and experience.

     14.     The appraisal followed ADB's general approach for public sector projects, but with less
     comprehensiveness. The time taken from CESC's request for assistance to ADB loan approval
     was approximately 13 months, which compared favorably with the time taken by commercial
     banks to approve industrial loans. The overall approach proved satisfactory, but inadequate
     attention was given to evaluating the Project's credit risk. The technical viability of
     improvements and impact on load growth in the absence of reinforcement and upgrading of the
     CESC system were not evaluated. If the Project's credit risk and technical inputs had been more
     comprehensively assessed, the potential for deterioration in CESC's financial performance
     might have become evident, and a sounder basis for ADB's involvement, and for CESC to meet
     its loan obligations, might have emerged (para. 54).

     B.      Achievement of Outputs

     15.     Actual outputs were as envisaged at appraisal and subsequently revised with hardly any
     variation (Table 1). Minor amendments followed detailed engineering assessments of the
     system, e.g., the envisaged 132 kV underground cable between New Cossipore and East
     Kolkata was replaced by the 132 kV underground cable between Barrackpur Trunk Road and
     East Kolkata; the power capacitor envisaged at Kasba was replaced by a capacitor at Mulajore;
     and the envisaged upgrading of Majerhat substation was transferred to another project (see
     Map).

C.     Cost and Scheduling

16.     At Rs2,312 million ($75.0 million), the actual total project cost was only 1% above the
revised estimate of February 1994. Financing was provided by IFC ($26.5 million), ADB
($18.8 million), local finance institutions ($15.3 million), and CESC ($14.4 million). The
increases in the US dollar equivalents of the ADB and IFC loans were attributable to favorable
currency variations against the US dollar in the pool of currencies borrowed by CESC. ADB's
loan financed 25% of the total project cost and 68% of the foreign exchange cost. IFC financed
the balance of the foreign exchange cost and 37% of the local currency cost. The remaining
local currency requirements were met by local finance institutions (32%) and CESC (31%)
(Appendix 2).

17.    The components of the original project scope were completed in December 1994,
3 months ahead of appraisal schedule. The additional components were completed in June
1996. To allow their financing, the closing date for ADB's loan was extended from 31 December
1995 to 10 September 1996.

D.     Procurement and Construction

18.     At appraisal, it was agreed that procurement would be undertaken in accordance with
CESC's standard procedures. The award of contracts for civil works and cable laying was to be
based on a minimum of three competitive bids. Procurement within India was to be based on
local competitive bidding, and major equipment items imported were to be procured through
international competitive bidding. These procedures were generally followed. The procurement
process involved multitier reviews within CESC before approval by the Central Electric
Authority. Documentation relating to items procured with ADB funding was forwarded to ADB for
review and approval. A summary of contract awards under ADB's loan is in Appendix 3.

19.    CESC reported that the international and domestic contractors and suppliers for the
Project had performed satisfactorily. All equipment inspected at the sites visited by the OEM
was functioning satisfactorily with no significant defects.

E.     Organization and Management

20.     Organization and management for implementation were consistent with arrangements
agreed at appraisal. Responsibility was totally vested with CESC, which had long experience
with implementing such transmission reinforcement and upgrading. Documentation and
inspection evidence available to the OEM and discussions with implementation personnel and
senior management confirmed that implementation had been satisfactory with respect to the
awarding of procurement and construction contracts, contracting of technical experts for training
the operators of new equipment, and in-house management covering detailed design and
construction supervision. ADB held coordination meetings with IFC at appraisal, and in 1994
when considering the project scope expansion.

21.     Apart from a loan review associated with the change in scope, ADB did not field any
review missions to monitor project implementation. This was consistent with the private
investment banking practice that provides for review only under special circumstances when the
interests of the bank and its investment are at stake. Monitoring relied on the submission of
bidding documents for equipment financed under ADB's loan, and reporting requirements as
covenanted under ADB's loan. The OEM found that CESC kept good records of project
accounts, and all documentation and reporting requirements were met satisfactorily.

                             III.     ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT PURPOSE

A.         Operational Performance

22.     Operational performance is measured in terms of the Project's achievements in
(i) extending and augmenting the 132 kV grid to transfer power between power plants and
substations, (ii) reinforcing overloaded 33 kV systems, (iii) reducing system losses on the
11/6 kV distribution systems, and (iv) improving system reliability. The adequacy of
maintenance is also reviewed.

23.     The improved 132 kV transmission links to alternative generating sources enabled
CESC to reduce its dependence on power supply from WBSEB that was impaired by frequent
outages, and improve the availability of power in the southern distribution area of CESC's
license. CESC's own generation as a proportion of total energy transmitted increased from
51% at appraisal to 62% in FY1995, and 82% by FY2001. The reliability of CESC's system to
meet load demand variations was also improved.

24.    With the two-stage commissioning of the 135 MW Southern power station in FY1990
and FY1991, CESC's power supply deficit, estimated at around 15%, was eliminated.
Responding to the increased availability of power and improvement in transmission capacity,
the average growth in CESC's energy sales accelerated from 1.8% per annum between FY1987
and FY1990 to 3.8% per annum between FY1990 and FY1995, but did not reach the 5.6%
appraisal forecast.

25.    The addition of nine new 33 kV substations preempted distribution losses that would have
otherwise occurred with further load growth.12 Without this expansion of the project scope and
augmentation of the 132 kV grid, CESC's transmission and distribution losses would have been at
least 4% higher. Table 2 gives performance indicators before and after the Project. Detailed
discussion of the operational and technical performance of the Project and CESC system is in
Appendix 4.

26.    Adequate general maintenance, including checks and monitoring of technical
performance at substations, is undertaken by CESC. Because the transmission lines
implemented under the Project were all laid underground, regular maintenance is not required.
The substations and the distribution equipment appear in good order and are operating at their

12
     During FY1994, WBSG relaxed some of its regulatory measures on the use of electricity. As a consequence, the
     growth in CESC's energy sales increased from 4.2% in FY1995 to 6.6% in FY1996. The unanticipated increase
     would, with further load growth, have led to overloading and a drop in voltage below the system design of 33 kV.
                                                                                                                        7


optimum design. General maintenance to meet safety standards at substation yards is variable.
Discussions with CESC engineers confirmed their understanding of transformer maintenance
and gas circuit-breaker handling requirements.

B.         Performance of the Operating Entity

           1.        Financial Performance

27.     CESC's financial performance over the period FY1987­FY1990 was characterized by
slow growth amidst persistent power shortages during evenings. While the number of customers
increased at 4.9% per annum during that period, the supply constraints kept the energy sales
growth at only 1.8% per annum. Net operating income (profit) before tax as a proportion of
equity and operating revenues averaged a moderate 11.8% and 2.7%, respectively. At 14.9%,
equity as a proportion of total assets was well below the commercial norm for ensuring financial
sustainability. Appraisal projections to FY2000 took into account the project implementation
schedule and the expected increase in generation from the Southern and Budge Budge power
stations. Electricity sales were expected to increase at an overall rate of around 5.6% per
annum. Consistent with CESC's past performance, profit before tax was projected to grow at
12.9% per annum and to be sufficient to maintain a rate of return on equity of around 12%, on
operating revenues of around 3%, and on net fixed assets of around 4%. The principle
established under the Sixth Schedule of the Electricity Supply Act (1948) for approving
electricity tariff adjustments to allow an after tax return on net fixed assets of 3% provided
confidence in these projections.

28.    The Project's investment in transmission and distribution equipment, spread over 6 years,
represented 45% of CESC's net fixed assets at appraisal, and 3% in FY2002. Although the
Project was a relatively small component of CESC's growing operations, it was essential for
improving these operations and avoiding inefficiencies that would have otherwise occurred with
continued load growth. CESC's financial viability was premised on CESC's capacity to meet its
debt servicing requirements. Critical to the financial projections at appraisal were underlying
assumptions relating to load growth, system losses, and tariff adjustments.

29.     Appendix 5 summarizes CESC's financial statements pertaining to its operations from
FY1988 to FY2002. The performance trend of CESC was one of solid improvement followed by
a rapid decline in profitability. Profit before tax increased from Rs129 million in FY1990 (2.6% of
revenues) to a maximum Rs896 million in FY1996 (7.5% of revenues), to turn into growing
losses from FY1998 onwards. Total assets grew by 33.0% per annum to Rs47.9 billion in
FY1996, and to a maximum Rs62.4 billion in FY1999, before easing to Rs58.9 billion in FY2001.
Equity to total assets strengthened from 17.9% to 53.3% in FY1994, before sliding to 34.7% in
FY2001. Significantly, and representing improved operational efficiencies, CESC's operating
expenditures before depreciation and interest declined from 85.9% of operating revenues in
FY1990 to 76.9% in FY2002.13 During the same period, the average tariff increased from
Rs1.34 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to Rs3.89 per kWh.14 This was equivalent to 9.3% per annum, as
against the average inflation rate of 7.3% per annum, and an increase in average operating cost
(excluding depreciation and interest) of 6.8% per annum. However, there was a significant
difference in the average tariff increase between FY1990 and FY1996 (10.6% per annum) and
that between FY1996 and FY2002 (8.0% per annum). As a result of this slowdown, the average
13
     The ratio fell to its lowest of 70.3% in FY2001.
14
     Still to be confirmed by the regulator. The electricity tariff is adjusted annually based on guidelines set under the
     India Electricity Supply Act (1948) and CESC's proposal. The system of adjustment worked satisfactorily until
     FY1995 when WBSG disagreed with CESC's proposed increase to recover fuel increases affecting operating costs
     in FY1994. Although the increase was forthcoming, approval was not ratified until December 1996. Thereafter,
     continuing disputes and claims arose, which led to further delays that accentuated CESC's financial losses.

tariff could not keep pace with the average operating cost (Appendix 5, Figure A5) and CESC
started incurring losses.

30.      Contributing to these overall trends were accounting treatments for the revaluation of
assets in FY1994, inadequate adjustments of electricity tariffs from FY1995 onwards, increased
interest on borrowings associated with an overreliance on loans to meet capital requirements,
and growing system losses.15 Table 3 provides a summary of the key financial performance
indicators between FY1989 and FY2002. ADB's loan covenant of a long-term debt to equity
ratio of no more than 3 was complied with only in FY1995 and FY 1996, while the debt service
ratio covenant of at least 1.1 times was complied with in every year except FY1998 and
FY2002. The covenants were intended as triggers for maintaining electricity tariffs so as to
ensure that revenues covered all operating expenses and taxes, loan interest and other
charges, and repayment of debts when due; and that a reasonable return on CESC's capital
base was generated, as defined in the Electricity Supply Act (1948).

31.     In January 2002, CESC defaulted on servicing its debt obligations to several lenders,
including ADB and IFC. This precipitated litigation from lenders through the Kolkata High Court
for recovery of interest and loan principal. ADB abstained as a participant to the injunction,
preferring to work with the Steering Committee16 to evolve a satisfactory restructuring of CESC's
loans. In a separate appeal for tariff relief, the Supreme Court's decision of 3 October 2002
(para. 37) to approve a tariff increase of 16.5% with adjustment for transmission and distribution
losses, allowed CESC to resume its loan-servicing obligations.17




15
   Among these, the one-off revaluation of assets led to a substantial increase in shareholders' funds and, therefore,
   increase in equity to total assets. Similarly, the decline in long-term borrowings to total assets occurred not
   because the former declined, but because the revaluation and growth in assets was large relative to the growth in
   borrowings.

           2.       Auditing Arrangements

32.     Local chartered accountants are reappointed on a yearly basis for an external audit of
CESC's accounts. The same firm of auditors has been reappointed since at least FY1987, and
the same format for presenting CESC's accounts has been followed. While auditing procedures
are believed to comply with the Government's requirements and standards, and generally open
disclosure exists for all accounting items, CESC's presentation of accounts and disclosure
details are not fully consistent with accepted international practice. Important areas requiring
more transparency include disclosure in the income statement covering provisions on the profit
and loss account and unpaid consumer bills, and provision for exchange rate changes on
foreign currency liabilities and extraordinary items. Important areas requiring more transparency
and alignment in the balance of accounts statement include the treatment and extent of unpaid
receivables, and the treatment of consumer deposits. Presentation in the standard balance
sheet format would help make the accounts of CESC more transparent and easier to interpret.

C.         Financial and Economic Reevaluation

33.     At appraisal, the financial and economic analysis covered benefits from all of CESC's
power investments planned for commissioning during the time-slice FY1991­FY1995. 18 The
base-case benefits assessed were considered conservative in terms of pricing and incremental
output, and implementation arrangements sufficient to enable project completion as scheduled
and within the estimated cost. Because the Project was to be implemented using proven
technology and methods, no major implementation risks were anticipated. The same time-slice
methodology was used in the PCR.

34.     The OEM has reestimated the EIRR and FIRR based on more detailed information than
was available at the time of the PCR. Differences between the appraisal, PCR, and OEM
estimates (Table 4) are explained by differences in the load and tariff levels. The EIRR reestimate
of 12.1% confirms the economic viability of CESC's investments, of which technical
improvements under the Project were a part, but are not fully captured in terms of avoided
outages and distribution losses, and improved voltage reliability. The FIRR of 6.3%, which
assumes transmission sufficiency to meet load growth up to FY2008 and takes into account the
cost of investments with taxes and duties, confirms the financial viability of CESC's investments
between FY1990 and FY1996. The FIRR is close to the average real weighted cost of capital
estimated at 6.7%, which takes into account the nominal lending rates on foreign and local
loans, together with a premium for the foreign exchange risk, an adjustment for corporate tax,
and an adjustment for inflation. A detailed account of the methodology and assumptions
underlying the FIRR and EIRR reestimates is in Appendix 6.

18
     Benefits expected from other projects included additional revenue benefits derived from the commissioning of
     Southern power station (135 MW), other upgrading, distribution, and miscellaneous projects commissioned during
     the period.
10


35.    A 10% increase in the average tariff in FY1997 would have improved the FIRR to 8.6%,
and the EIRR to 14.2%. Similarly, if a 10% tariff increase is assumed for FY2003, an FIRR of
7.9% is obtained. Such an increase has some bearing on future tariff adjustments to be sought
from the regulator. Should the load growth during FY2003­FY2008 be 10% higher than the
OEM's projection, the FIRR and EIRR will improve to 6.9% and 12.9%, respectively.

D.       Sustainability

36.     The sustainability of project benefits depends on planning, the timely matching of capacity
with growth in load demand, optimal system management, and maintenance. Planning follows
CESC's master plan, last prepared in FY1994, for operations improvement. Generation sufficiency
is being met together with back-up generation capacity available from WBSEB.19 The additional
transmission capacity installed under the Project will not reach its maximum for many years so
that in the unlikely event of a shutdown in generation, technical sustainability is reasonably
assured. However, transformer capacity across CESC's network is sufficient only for the next
3 years, and higher transformer capacities will be needed to avoid load shedding.20 System
management is conducted satisfactorily and attention is being paid to further upgrading of CESC's
network. Maintenance requirements are being met satisfactorily.

37.      The timely matching of technical improvements with load growth is dependent on
CESC's capacity to meet its investment requirements. Since FY1995, adjustments in the
electricity tariff have been irregular, and distribution losses have climbed with an adverse impact
on CESC's profits, dividends, and share price. To avoid performance failure in the future, these
issues need to be addressed, together with financial restructuring and a change in management
modus operandi toward meeting future investment needs. The OEM's discussions with CESC
management showed that there was awareness of the situation and constructive steps were
being taken. A world-renowned investment bank was engaged to advise on financial
restructuring. Issues surrounding the principles for approving electricity tariff adjustments were
clarified under the Supreme Court's judgment of 3 October 2002, which should lead to more
timely future adjustments. CESC was taking measures to reduce its transmission and
distribution losses (Appendix 4), and WBSG introduced harsh penalties for electricity theft, and
improved court processing for enforcement. After having steadily increased from 14.6% in
FY1991 to 23.7% in FY2001, the transmission and distribution losses decreased for the first
time in FY2002, to 21.8%, and a further significant decline is expected in FY2003. These efforts
provide ground for some optimism that CESC can overcome its financial difficulties. However,
the basis for adjusting tariffs is still likely to require review (para. 51). Regular injections of equity
capital are also needed, which to date has not been seen as necessary, or providing a sufficient
commercial return. 21 In the absence of more definitive planning and commitment from the major
shareholder, the financial viability of CESC's operations is uncertain. This uncertainty applies to
the total operations of CESC, as opposed to the sustainability of project benefits, which are
reasonably assured.

                   IV.      ACHIEVEMENT OF OTHER DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS

A.       Socioeconomic Impact

38.   The socioeconomic situation in the project areas was not assessed at appraisal or during
implementation. The OEM also could not reliably measure social benefits derived from the

19
   CESC's transmission network is connected to WBSEB at Howrah, Kasba, Lillooah, and Titagarh substations.
20
   Provision for upgrading is currently planned at Auckland and Park Lane substations.
21
   In the short term, it may be necessary to first divest some of CESC's operations in order to normalize its financial
   gearing.
                                                                                                 11


Project, but CESC operators and users in the project areas visited reported that the reliability of
supply improved and there were fewer outages during evenings. These improvements were seen
to have widened the scope of commercial activities, enhanced the quality of life, and improved the
environments in which people worked.

39.    One of the factors taken into account for approval of ADB's loan was the expected
stimulus to industrial growth that the improved availability and reliability of power would provide.
Acceleration in industrial growth was expected to spur economic activity and, in turn, lead to
increased electricity demand from households and small businesses. This expected outcome
does not appear to have occurred. At appraisal, energy consumption by industry was growing at
about 2.4% per annum. Between FY1990 and FY1996, the growth slowed to 2.1% per annum,
despite the increased availability of power. From FY1996 to FY2002, there was zero growth in
energy sales to industry. The OEM was unable to establish the reasons for the lack of industrial
growth despite the improved availability and reliability of power.

40.     The Project was gender neutral with no stated objective to assist women during or after
implementation. Project benefits for women accrued largely in the form of improved availability
of electricity, in particular less outages during evenings, in their homes.

B.     Environmental Impact

41.     Environmental aspects relating to the Project were not specifically addressed at appraisal,
except for ADB's loan covenants requiring CESC to ensure that the Project was implemented with
due regard to environmental and pollution control laws. The Project had no significant adverse
impact on the environment. The 132 kV transmission lines were laid underground consistent with
established practice, which avoided concerns relating to tower construction, minimum height
clearance, and safety. The new substations are fenced off, and noise pollution from transformers
is not audible outside the fence boundaries. Personnel safety measures against accidental high-
voltage electrocution were built into the design and ground cover of the substations. For some
substations, more diligent attention to controlling weed growth around the equipment is warranted.
Procedures against the accidental operation of switchgear at the new and upgraded substations
are appropriate.

C.     Impact on Institutions and Policy

42.    Appraisal included a review of CESC's organization, management, and operations. CESC
was found to have the relevant experience to satisfactorily implement the Project. Suboptimal
features associated with aged equipment, obsolete technologies, and multiple voltage distribution
systems were noted, and it was recognized that CESC was taking measures to address the need
for modernizing. Procedures for and experience in procurement were considered appropriate.
Consequently, s pecific provision for institutional strengthening was not considered necessary.

                               V.      OVERALL ASSESSMENT

A.     Relevance

43.    The Project's rationale to help meet the suppressed demand for electricity in Kolkata,
and in so doing assist industrialization, was consistent with the Government's Eighth Plan
(FY1991­FY1995) and ADB's assistance strategy to facilitate economic growth. Significant in
ADB's decision to support the Project was the private sector status of CESC; the already high
exposure of the local finance institutions and a new law restricting their lending to a maximum of
40% of the investment cost; and power shortages in Kolkata that were impeding industry and
12


economic growth. The Project improved the availability, reliability, and security of power supply
to consumers by enhancing CESC's transmission and load management capacity. The nine
new substations were important for containing downstream distribution losses. In consideration
of these factors, the Project's rationale, purpose and outputs are assessed as relevant.

B.     Efficacy

44.     The expansion of the project scope and the redesign of some components following
detailed engineering were appropriate. Civil works for the 132 kV transmission underground
cable were completed satisfactorily and in accord with established practice. Installation of
equipment for the two new 132/33 kV substations and nine new 33 kV substations was of a high
order. The project outputs achieved their design purpose of expanding CESC's transmission
capacity and avoiding transmission and distribution losses that would have otherwise occurred,
but were not of a sufficient scale to achieve a reduction in CESC's overall losses. Although the
Project helped remove power constraints on industrial growth, it was insufficient on its own to
effect such growth. The Project, in achieving its stated purpose and principal targets, is
assessed as efficacious.

C.     Efficiency

45.     Implementation efficiency in terms of cost and schedule was satisfactory. The expansion
of the project scope required installation of additional equipment and was responsible for the
additional time needed for project completion. System management at generation and
transmission is satisfactory. The reestimated EIRR of 12.1% attests to the economic viability of
CESC's investments made over the period FY1990­FY1996. The reestimate exceeds ADB's
efficiency benchmark, but is significantly lower than the appraisal figure. Overall, the Project's
implementation and performance are assessed as efficient.

D.     Sustainability

46.      CESC's capacity to meet Kolkata's growing electricity needs is strongly dependent on
timely injections of equity capital matched with loan support. To date, CESC has relied largely on
borrowings to meet its capital requirements, and the interest cost has impaired the financial
viability of its operations. CESC's financial capacity to meet expansion requirements, contain
transmission and distribution losses, and also meet loan-servicing obligations is uncertain. While
this uncertainty applies to CESC's total operations, the additional transmission capacity installed
under the Project will not reach its maximum for many years and maintenance of the equipment is
sound so that technical sustainability is reasonably assured. Accordingly, the sustainability of
benefits generated by the Project per se is assessed as likely.

E.     Institutional Development and Other Impacts

47.    Project support for institutional strengthening was limited to ADB's loan covenants that
were aimed at providing early signals for adjusting tariffs and at ensuring observance of reporting
requirements on project implementation and CESC's financial operations. The Project, while
improving the availability of electricity for industry, was not sufficient to spur industrial growth,
which actually slowed. However, it allowed expansion in new connections for commercial and
domestic consumers that widened the scope for commercial activities, and improved their home
and work environment. Overall, institutional, economic, and other impacts of the Project are
judged moderate.
                                                                                                                  13


F.       Overall Project Rating

48.     The Project is rated successful.22 It enabled CESC to meet transmission requirements
for the new generation units at the Southern and Budge Budge power stations, thus helping
eliminate a 15% supply deficit. Detracting from a higher rating is the FIRR of 6.3%, which
although close to the average real weighted cost of capital, reflects CESC's weakening financial
performance that renders uncertain its capacity to fully meet future investment requirements and
financial obligations.

G.       Assessment of ADB and Borrower Performance

49.    ADB's overall performance is assessed as partly satisfactory. ADB's appraisal was
inadequate in evaluation of technical inputs and credit assessment. With a more comprehensive
evaluation, ADB could have been instrumental in achieving a fuller project impact, and helping
CESC secure a better basis for meeting its future capital requirements. A sounder basis for
ADB's involvement and management of its loan investment would have been provided. Since
the July 1990 appraisal, loan processing procedures for ADB's private sector operations have
been strengthened. 23

50.     CESC's performance is assessed as satisfactory, notwithstanding the weaknesses in its
financial management. CESC competently managed project implementation. Procurement was
carried out in accordance with competitive bidding procedures, and the original scope
completed within the appraised cost and schedule. Cooperation with ADB was good, and
adequate records of every detail of project implementation were kept. Detracting from a higher
assessment are financial difficulties experienced by CESC due to delayed tariff increases, an
overreliance on meeting capital requirements from borrowed funds, and rising distribution
losses.

                      VI.      ISSUES, LESSONS, AND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

A.       Key Issues for the Future

51.     Privatization and Regulatory Failure. CESC's license passes responsibility for
meeting investment requirements to the private sector. Up to the present, CESC has viewed
solutions to its expansion needs as a function of the availability of loan support. The public
shareholding base of CESC is not used to raise equity for the purpose of partly funding CESC's
investment needs.24 The underlying principle of the Electricity Supply Act (1948) whereby the
Government undertakes to approve an adjustment to the electricity tariff to meet the full cost of
supply is a disincentive to do so. A review of CESC's financial management strategy and of the
principle for adjusting CESC's electricity tariff as provided under the Act is warranted.

52.     The monopoly development of CESC under regulatory control 25 has contributed to its
declining financial performance. Generation, transmission, and distribution operations remain
22
   Using the revised four-category rating system (highly successful, successful, partly successful, and unsuccessful).

   ADB. 2001. Private Sector Operations Strategic Direction and Review. Manila.
24
   Limited rights issues attached to nonconvertible redeemable debentures were offered.
25
   While CESC is a public company whose shares are majority owned by a private investor group and listed on the
   London and India stock exchanges, its license to supply and distribute power is in reality permission to operate at
   intervals (of about 10 years), after which WBSG has a "deferred option to purchase the undertaking." In effect, the
   Government can nationalize the operations of CESC if the benefits of privatizing the supply and distribution of
   electricity are not in the public interest. To ensure that the public interest is not exploited by the monopoly
   operations of CESC, WBSEB is the appointed regulator responsible, among other matters, for reviewing and
   approving (or otherwise) adjustments to the electricity tariff. CESC must also obtain approval for additional
   investments, which until FY1988 precluded CESC from investing in generation.
14


bundled and without legal independence and accountability. The lack of legal entities under
which the key operational areas are structured presents difficulties for lenders to collateralize
their loan investments and offer more favorable lending terms. The lack of corporatization of
CESC's operations also means that expenditures and revenues between generation and
distribution are not legally separable. The need for internal restructuring of CESC's operations is
evident, as is the need to restructure the Kolkata power sector so that competition is introduced
and regulatory intervention minimized. New entrants should be encouraged in generation, and
responsibility for expanding distribution extended to additional operators. Divestment of CESC's
Budge Budge power station and the involvement of a strategic investor in CESC also merit
consideration.

53.     Value Added by ADB. ADB's financing followed appraisal procedures commonly
practiced in commercial banks. There was a minimum of project administration, except for
monitoring compliance with loan covenants related to reporting and loan servicing, and
extending approval for CESC to utilize loan savings for an expansion in project scope. Such
minimum involvement is consistent with global investment banking practice. The issue,
therefore, arises as to how ADB can provide added value in its development role for private
sector lending, and whether ADB's appraisal and administration of private sector proposals are
appropriate.

54.     One weakness evident at project formulation was the lack of technical verification by
ADB that the project design would achieve its stated purpose and performance targets. Even
the expanded scope, although beneficial, was of insufficient scale to contain CESC's overall
transmission and distribution losses. Another weakness was the lack of credit assessment on
CESC and its principal shareholder, despite ADB's loan being without government guarantee
and independent security. The lack of standalone collateral and practical difficulties associated
with legal recourse in the event of default meant that ADB was lending on a promissory basis--
a feature that was later repeated for ADB's second loan to CESC (footnote 8). Loan security
could have been strengthened with more attention to loan structuring, and ADB's exposure
lessened through sell-down arrangements. Long-term investment lending to the private sector
would normally entail (i) identifying the risks, (ii) setting an interest rate commensurate with the
long-term risk and security, and (iii) underwriting or selling down the lead lender's loan to other
international investors. ADB's private sector operations arm would add value to its impact if it
looked to increase the volume of its lending through an increased involvement in underwriting,
and selling down. Essential to that process is a comprehensive and high-quality credit
assessment at appraisal that is also made available to other underwriters and potential fund
investors.

B.     Lessons Identified

55.   The key lesson is that with a more comprehensive technical evaluation and credit
assessment at appraisal, the project scope necessary to achieve CESC's performance targets
could have been more reliably identified. This lesson and a few others from the OEM's
observations of CESC's operations are reflected in the recommended follow-up actions below.

C.     Follow-Up Actions

56.    ADB should ensure more comprehensive appraisal when processing future private
sector projects.

57.    CESC should (i) consider restructuring and corporatizing its generation, transmission,
and distribution so that the operations of each entity are independent with separate pricing and
                                                                                                    15


accountability for expenditures and revenues; and (ii) make more use of bond and equity
markets to meet its investment requirements.

58.    WBSG should (i) restructure the power sector and introduce competition in the provision of

                           OPERATIONAL AND TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE1

A.        Design

1.      The 132 kilovolt (kV) transmission lines installed under the Project used 132 kV
crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) insulated copper cables laid underground, which are
appropriate for a densely populated city area. The lines are not visible except where cables are
connected with overground equipment. The termination points appeared well built, and there
were no reports of problems with them.

2.     The 132 kV substations erected at Jadavpur and East Kolkata were of conventional
outdoor design with main and transfer bus configuration. The 132 kV substations at Prinsep
Street and Park Lane, where land was the main constraint, included gas-insulated switchgear
(GIS) with double bus bar configuration. For stepping down 132 kV transmission voltage to
33 kV distribution voltage, 50 megavolt-ampere transformers were installed at Jadavpur and
East Kolkata substations, and a 75 megavolt-ampere transformer installed at Park Lane
substation.

3.      The design of the 132 kV and 33 kV substations and transformers was in accord with
national and international design standards. The main and transfer bus configuration for outdoor
substations, and double bus bar configuration for GIS, provided flexibility in operation and
enhanced power availability. At Jadavpur and East Kolkata, space was kept for future
expansion of the substation capacity for one 132 kV/33 kV transformer. Most other substations
in the Calcutta Electric Supply Company's (CESC's) network are similarly planned.

4.      The functional design of substations was appropriate. A minor improvement in design for
the better storage of spares was possible at Jadavpur.

B.        Operation and Maintenance

5.     The main equipment items at substations are summarized in Table A4.1, and power
loads carried by the 132 kV and 33 kV transformers at each substation are summarized in Table
A4.2.

6.      During discussions, operation staff indicated there were no major operating problems for
the 132 kV and 33 kV substations, transformers, and other equipment. No abnormal leakage of
sulfur hexafluoride gas from circuit breakers and GIS were reported or observed during site
inspections. Oil seepage from the two transformers of Auckland Square was scheduled for
repair. No abnormal leakage from transformers was observed in other substations inspected.

7.      As GIS was used for the first time in CESC's system, key operation and maintenance
staff of CESC took training in the manufacturer's works in Germany. Maintenance of
transformers and other equipment is carried out regularly. Stocks of spare parts required for
maintenance of equipment are also maintained.

8.     Equipment at the 132 kV and 33 kV substations is maintained satisfactorily. At Jadavpur,
grass and weeds around the transformers and bus plant had grown through the graveled
ground cover and were jeopardizing the safety features in the substation design. More diligence
should be applied to maintaining safety design features.

    All lines were laid underground. The lines were of copper cable construction, single core, 630 square millimeters, and insulated with crosslinked
    polyethylene (XLPE). Because transmission is carried out in three phases, and cable is required for each phase, the actual length of cable is
    three times the length of the line specified.

    Extension and upgrading of Majerhat substation was transferred from the original scope to another Calcutta Electric Supply Company project.

C.        System Losses

9.     CESC's system losses (auxiliary losses and transmission and distribution [T&D] losses),
along with other operation performance indicators, are shown in Table A4.3. There was a
steady increase on T&D losses from FY1991 to FY1997 (from 14.6% to 20.0%). T&D losses
decreased to 19.3% in FY1998 and thereafter increased to 23.7% in FY2001. Upgrading of
CESC's transmission system to a higher voltage, and addition of distribution substations,
prevented T&D losses across CESC's total system from being at least 4% higher.

10.     Not unrelated to the increase in CESC's T&D losses is the increase in new connections
by 873,000 or 91% between FY1990 and FY2002, representing 48% of CESC's total consumer
connections. Most of the increase was for small business and domestic connections. At least
one third of CESC's increase in T&D losses is attributable to increased technical losses.

11.    T&D losses of CESC are lower than those of most other areas in India. In FY1998,
CESC's T&D losses were 19.3% compared with national average of 23.7%, Delhi's 48.1%,
Haryana's 35.2%, Andhra Pradesh's 34.1%, and Chandigarh's 29.7%.1 CESC's T&D losses of
19.3% were also lower than those of the Ahmedabad Electric Company Limited (20.1%) but
higher than those of Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Limited (16.8%). Technical losses of
CESC are estimated to be below 12%, with the balance attributed to pilferage and inaccurate
meters. CESC is taking aggressive steps to reduce its losses and has introduced a program for
upgrading meters, installing capacitors, upgrading its transmission system to higher voltages,
and taking legal action against pilferage. The West Bengal State Government has introduced
harsh penalties for theft and improved court processing for enforcement. T&D losses decreased
from 23.7% in FY2001 to 21.8% in FY2002, and are expected to fall significantly in FY2003.

D.        System Voltages

12.     At all the substations inspected, the system voltages were observed to be normal. The
132 kV system was operating at about 131 kV­132 kV, and the 33 kV at 31 kV­33 kV. All
transformers were provided with an on-load tap changer, which helps maintain optimal voltage
with changing load conditions.

E.        System Control

13.    All the five generating stations of CESC are interconnected and synchronized with the
West Bengal State Electricity Board. 2 Total system demand and availability of power from own
generation determine the necessary quantum of imported power. Presently, CESC's load
management and system control are managed using a supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) system introduced in 1996. The SCADA system, although technically obsolete, is
operated effectively. Data monitoring is automatic, control is manual, and communication is by
telephone. A modern SCADA system would allow the system operators to schedule generation
more efficiently and achieve a further saving in T&D losses. CESC's future development plans
include provisions for upgrading the SCADA system.

                              FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC REEVALUATION

A.        Methodology at Appraisal

1.      The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and economic internal rate of return (EIRR)
were calculated on the basis of all project additions (planned and under construction) to the
Calcutta Electric Supply Company (CESC) Limited power system for the time-slice FY1987­
FY1995. 1 The time-slice took into account (i) all investment expenditure from FY1987, including
that for the Southern power station, which was expected to be commissioned in two phases
over FY1991 and FY1992; and (ii) all expected incremental operating and maintenance costs
and incremental energy revenue from FY1990 onwards. A 25-year period, FY1990­FY2015,
was used for the calculation.

2.      The FIRR calculation included expected direct taxes and duties on capital items, which
the EIRR calculation excluded. Operation and maintenance costs were calculated based on
separate assessments for fuel requirements (namely, the cost of coal); power purchased; and
other costs covering salaries and wages, repairs and maintenance, and administration. All costs
and benefits were valued at constant 1990 prices. Costs excluded financial charges,
depreciation, and indirect taxes. An average tariff of Rs1.31 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) was used in
FY1991 and FY1992 to value incremental energy sales, Rs1.30/kWh in FY1993 and FY1994,
and Rs1.29/kWh from FY1995 onwards. For the EIRR calculation, a standard conversion factor
of 0.8 was used to convert domestic prices (applied to the local currency component of capital
costs and the whole of operation and maintenance costs) into economic equivalent prices. The
economic tariff was assumed equivalent to the financial tariff on the basis of consumers'
willingness to pay at least 100% of the tariff billed. The FIRR and EIRR so obtained were 8.9%
and 15.9%, respectively.

B.        Methodology at Evaluation

3.      The Asian Development Bank's project completion report (PCR) and Operations
Evaluation Mission (OEM) independently reestimated the FIRR and EIRR following the same
time-slice approach, but based on more factual information relating to investment costs,
operating expenditures, and revenues. The OEM reestimates are based on actual operating
expenditures and revenues up to FY2002.

4.        Tables A6.1 and A6.2 show the FIRR and EIRR benefit and cost streams calculated by
the OEM. The load increase represents the load taken up as a result of increased generation
and improved transmission capacity under the Project. Differences between the appraisal, PCR,
and OEM estimates are largely explained by the underlying assumptions for load forecasts and
tariff level. These differences are summarized in Table A6.3.

5.      For the FIRR, investment costs take into account the capital expenditures associated
with technical services, equipment purchases, civil construction, and taxes and duties paid on
equipment items, less income taxes. The EIRR investment costs are calculated similarly, but
exclude duties and taxes paid. The tradeables portion of investment and operating costs is
multiplied by the domestic numeraire of 1.1 to arrive at the economic equivalence value.



1
    It was felt that the nature of the transmission line projects was such that a meaningful FIRR and EIRR could not be
    calculated for the Project alone.

  Representing energy losses avoided. Measuring limitations without the aid of a computer simulation model did not
  enable the energy savings from avoided losses to be estimated. They are not included in the financial internal rate
  of return (FIRR) or economic internal rate of return (EIRR) estimates. Approximate savings of 160 GWh per year
  were realized. If these savings were included in the reestimates, the FIRR would increase from 6.3% to 9.6% and
  the EIRR from 12.1% to 14.2%.

6.      The load increase was measured in terms of the actual increase in energy sales from
FY1990 to FY2002, and projected to reach 80% of the design limit for CESC's transmission
equipment in FY2008. 2 Thereafter, the load increase was held constant. The financial revenue
benefits were derived from the load increase and the actual average tariff (revalued in constant
2002 prices) applicable from FY1990 to FY2002. No change in the FY2002 average tariff was
assumed thereafter, implying constant tariffs in real terms. Similarly, the associated financial
operating cost was derived from the load increase and the sum of CESC's unit operating costs
revalued in constant 2002 prices. The economic benefits equal the sum of (i) resource cost
savings arising from new consumers switching from kerosene or diesel fuel, (ii) willingness to
pay benefits, and (iii) increment in operating revenues generated associated with increased
electricity consumption per consumer. Not taken into account for the EIRR reestimate is the
incremental energy savings from avoided losses as a result of technical improvements (Table
A6.3, footnote c).
