                                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

       The Government of India developed a long-term power development program under the
Seventh Five-Year Plan (FY1985-1989). The program aimed to alleviate severe power
shortages that were serious constraints to economic growth. The program included several
thermal power stations utilizing the country's large coal reserves. The North Madras Thermal
Power Project (the Project)1 was an integral part of the national power development program.

         The main purpose of the Project was to expand the generating capacity of the Tamil
Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB), the Executing Agency, by installing north of Madras (now
Chennai) two units of 210 megawatts (MW) each to meet the prevailing and anticipated power
shortages in Tamil Nadu. The Project comprised (i) civil works for site preparation, foundations,
the power station building, and water circulation and other systems; (ii) two 690 ton/hour
capacity coal-fired steam boilers and auxiliaries; (iii) two reheat steam turbine generators each
with a rated capacity of 210 MW and auxiliaries; (iv) instrumentation and control systems; (v) coal
and ash handling systems; (vi) water treatment and other miscellaneous mechanical equipment;
(vii) transformers, switchyard equipment, and other miscellaneous electrical equipment; and
(viii) consulting services.

        The Operations Evaluation Mission visited India in March 2002, and held discussions
with the officials and experts connected with the Project and the staff of the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) India Resident Mission.

       The Central Electricity Authority formulated the Project. The Project was prepared
without an ADB project preparatory technical assistance. Plant design and engineering were
technically sound and appropriate in the context of the urgent need for additional generating
capacity.

        At appraisal, the total project cost was estimated at $628 million equivalent, comprising
$254 million in foreign exchange costs (40% of the total cost) and $374 million equivalent (60%
of the total cost) in local currency costs. The actual project cost at completion was $469 million
equivalent, comprising $176 million (38%) in foreign exchange costs and $293 million equivalent
(62%) in local currency costs. The significant savings resulted mainly from (i) a major
depreciation of the rupee during implementation, (ii) strong competition among international and
domestic bidders for ADB-financed contract packages, and (iii) overestimated price
contingencies.

       The commissioning of units 1 and 2 was originally scheduled in March and December
1991, respectively. Several factors led to major delays: land acquisition problems; procurement
delays in the award of contracts (due to excessive time taken by TNEB for bid evaluation,
lengthy internal approvals of contract awards within TNEB, and additional lengthy process for
approval of awards by the Central Electricity Authority and the Government of Tamil Nadu
[GTN] before submission to ADB for approval); and considerable delays in the implementation
of some contracts, particularly that for the internal coal handling system (ICHS).

       Units 1 and 2 were eventually commissioned in October 1994 and March 1995, more
than 3 years behind schedule. However, their optimum utilization was not possible due to the
delay in the commissioning of the ICHS, which became fully operational only in June 1999.
Thus the total delay in project implementation was 6.5 years.

1
     Loan 798-IND: North Madras Thermal Power Project, for $150 million, approved on 18 November 1986.
      As envisaged at appraisal, the Project provided the additional generating capacity of 420
MW and enabled TNEB to optimize the operation of its hydropower generation facilities.
However, until the commissioning of the ICHS, plant performance suffered. Since the ICHS was
commissioned in June 1999, performance has been very good with plant load factors exceeding
80%.

        Operation and maintenance personnel have been adequately trained by TNEB. With the
commissioning of the external coal handling system in January 2002, the availability of coal has
further improved. The coal delivered by sea will be also cheaper than that delivered by rail.
Future funding for the required operation and maintenance is not expected to be a problem.
Thus, the long-term sustainability of the Project is likely.

        Apart from the major delay, the Project has satisfactorily achieved its objectives. The
additional energy generated is consumed mainly by domestic, industrial, and commercial
consumers in urban areas, and by a limited number of agricultural consumers. The Project's
economic internal rate of return of 14.2% and its financial internal rate of return of 8.4% both
confirm its high efficiency. The actual cost, being lower than the appraisal estimates, and
excellent plant performance have more than compensated for the delay. Further, the
substantive issues relating to the environment and resettlement have been addressed
satisfactorily. There still remains the procedural issue of obtaining environmental compliance
from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. Overall, the Project is rated successful.

         The key indicator of the financial performance of TNEB is the 3% surplus required under
Section 59 of the Electricity Act. The Loan Agreement stipulated that TNEB would maintain
tariffs at a level to achieve the 3% surplus. However, given GTN's decision to give power freely
to agricultural consumers, this was not possible and hence subventions were needed from GTN
to achieve the stipulated surplus. These subventions have become a significant burden on
GTN's budgetary resources.

         As regards future power projects, the key issue, which is of national relevance, is the
financial viability of the state electricity boards. Two major factors contributing to the poor state
of the state electricity boards' finances are the politically driven tariffs and inefficient meter
reading and bill collection. The Government and the state governments have agreed to
depoliticize the power sector reforms and implement them expeditiously, with particular
emphasis on power distribution. This provides a unique opportunity for ADB to take a lead role
in distribution sector reform in India and provide the requisite technical and financial assistance,
with privatization of distribution systems a precondition for receiving loan assistance.

       TNEB is advised to take the following actions by December 2002:

       (i)     resolve the issue of how and where to discharge cooling water in the sea and
               obtain approval from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for plant operation;
               and

       (ii)    improve plant safety and ensure that workers use the safety equipment procured
               by TNEB, including safety helmets.

A.        Rationale

1.     With a view to alleviating the severe power shortages experienced in India, which in turn
were serious constraints to economic growth, the Government developed a long-term power
development program under the Seventh Five-Year Plan (FY1985-1989). The program included
several thermal power generating stations, utilizing the country's large coal reserves.

2.      The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) in the State of Tamil Nadu was the second
largest power generation system in the Southern Region, with a total installed capacity of 3,553
megawatts (MW) in 1986. TNEB's power development program in the early 1980s added two
210 MW units at each of two thermal power stations in Tuticorin and Mettur. However, even with
the progressive increases in TNEB's thermal capacity, the huge annual deficit of over 4,000
gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electrical energy was a persistent problem affecting economic growth
in the 1980s in Tamil Nadu. The power outages caused significant disruptions in the operations
of industrial consumers who accounted for over 55% of total consumption.

3.       The North Madras Thermal Power Project (the Project)1 was an integral part of the
national power development program. It aimed at not only reducing the generating capacity
deficit, but also providing the much-needed base-load backup for the then largely seasonal
hydropower-based system in Tamil Nadu.

4.      The country operational strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for India at the
time of appraisal sought to assist the Government's industrialization efforts directly by providing
financial assistance for industrial projects and indirectly for removing the bottlenecks in
infrastructure, particularly in the crucial power sector. The Project was prepared before the
introduction of the policy to promote private sector participation in the form of independent
power producers.

B.        Formulation

5.      The Project was identified as an integral component of the national power development
program formulated by the Central Electricity Authority, based on detailed capacity optimization
system studies. The project location was decided on the basis of least-cost studies for coal
transportation and water availability for cooling as well as for steam production. The coastal
location of the Project provided for coal transportation by coastal shipping, thereby relieving the
already strained rail sector from the additional burden of transporting coal for the Project from
eastern coalfields. It also provided flexibility for importing coal if necessary. The technical design
and detailed engineering for the Project were carried out in August 1985 by an experienced
domestic consulting firm engaged by TNEB, the Executing Agency. ADB appraised the Project
in September 1986 and considered the project report prepared by TNEB satisfactory. ADB also
assessed that TNEB had the required technical competence, as demonstrated by the
successful completion of two thermal power stations in the 1980s.

C.        Purpose and Outputs

6.       The main purpose of the Project was to expand the generating capacity of TNEB in
order to meet the prevailing and anticipated power shortages in Tamil Nadu. The Project
assisted in building a new coal-fired thermal power station located approximately 25 kilometers
north of Madras (now Chennai), the capital of Tamil Nadu. The Project constituted Phase I of
the first stage development of the power station to provide a generating capacity of 420 MW.2
The Project comprised the following components:

          (i)      civil works for site preparation, foundations, the power station building, and
                   cooling water and other systems;
          (ii)     two 690 ton/hour capacity coal-fired steam boilers and auxiliaries;
          (iii)    two reheat steam turbine generators each with a rated capacity of 210 MW and
                   auxiliaries;
          (iv)     instrumentation and control systems;
          (v)      coal and ash handling systems;
          (vi)     water treatment and other miscellaneous mechanical equipment;
          (vii)    transformers, switchyard equipment, and other miscellaneous electrical
                   equipment; and
          (viii)   consulting services.

D.        Cost, Financing, and Executing Arrangements

7.      At appraisal, the total project cost was estimated at $628 million equivalent comprising
$254 million (40% of the total cost) in foreign exchange costs and $374 million equivalent (60%
of the total cost) in local currency costs (Appendix 1).

8.     The Member (Generation) of TNEB was designated to be in charge of the Project. The
Chief Engineer (Thermal) was responsible for coordination with the consultants, procurement,
and monitoring. The Chief Engineer (Civil Designs) was responsible for procurement of civil
works. Actual project implementation was supervised by the Chief Engineer (Projects) and was
supported by about 200 experienced professional staff. As stated in the Loan Agreement, the
Chief Engineer (Planning) was the overall coordinator with ADB. TNEB was assisted in the
implementation of the Project by an experienced domestic consulting firm for project
engineering, preparation of technical specifications, preparation of bid documents, bid
evaluation, review of vendors' drawings, preparation of operation and maintenance manuals,
and construction supervision.

E.        Completion and Self-Evaluation

9.      The project completion report (PCR) circulated in April 2001 covered comprehensively
all relevant aspects of project implementation. The PCR was well documented, balanced, and
objective. The evaluation of the key aspects of the Project--costs, schedule, procurement of
goods and services, environmental and social impacts, disbursements, conditions and
covenants, performances of the Borrower, TNEB, and ADB, and the initial benefits--was

    The power station was planned to be developed in three stages, comprising three units of 210 MW in the first
    stage, two units of 525 MW in the second stage, and one unit of 525 MW in the final stage, to bring the ultimate
    capacity to 2,205 MW. The third 210 MW unit was financed under Loan 1029-IND: Second North Madras Thermal
    Power Project, for $200 million, approved on 30 August 1990.

supported by adequate documentation and analysis.3 The PCR reported that considerable
savings in foreign exchange had resulted from the major depreciation of the rupee during
implementation, with lower bid prices (in dollar terms) offered by domestic contractors who won
many international competitive bidding contracts. The net amount of the ADB loan disbursed
was $110.4 million. The unused amount of $39.6 million was cancelled in phases.4 The PCR
recorded the startup problems such as the lack of a proper project inception report, delayed
land acquisition due to litigation, and other procurement and implementation problems, all of
which contributed to the long delay in project completion. The overall conclusion of the PCR
was that the Project was implemented substantially as conceived during appraisal, albeit with
considerable delays.

10.    The PCR also concluded that the issues relating to environment and safety were not
adequately addressed. TNEB implemented measures to mitigate the adverse effects of the
Project on the environment. However, at the time of the project completion review mission,
although the power plant was operating, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) had
not given its formal consent to do so, as there was still a disagreement on the location of the
discharge point for the cooling water. Moreover, TNEB had not implemented the safety
measures for power station workers (such as requiring them to use safety belts, boots, and
helmets) and environmental protection measures concerning the residents in the areas near the
ash pond.

11.    The PCR was also correct to note that the high turnover of key personnel detracted from
a sense of ownership of the Project. Based on the low financial internal rate of return (FIRR), of
4.0% the PCR concluded that the Project was partly successful.5

F.        Operations Evaluation

12.     The main focus of the project performance audit report (PPAR) is to assess the
relevance, efficacy, efficiency, sustainability, and institutional and developmental impacts of the
Project and identify lessons and follow-up actions, as well as suggestions for sector policies and
strategies for future ADB operations.

13.      The PPAR presents the findings of the Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM) that visited
India in March 2002. The PPAR is based on findings of the OEM and the analysis of data
collected during field visits. It also incorporates information from discussions with the officials
and experts connected with the Project, and comments received at the workshops at ADB's
India Resident Mission and headquarters. Copies of the draft PPAR were provided to the
Government, TNEB, and concerned ADB staff for review; comments were considered in
finalizing the PPAR.

    TNEB revised the actual costs subsequently. Those are used in the Operations Evaluation Mission's analysis
    (Table 2 and para. 18).

    In June 1992, ADB and the Government initially agreed to use the loan savings under the loan to partly finance the
    external coal handling system that was included in the follow-on project (footnote 2). Subsequently, in 1996, to
    rationalize ADB's loan portfolio in India, ADB decided to cancel the loan savings.

                    II.       PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION PERFORMANCE

A.        Formulation and Design

14.     The Government's Seventh Five-Year Plan (FY1985-1989) placed strong emphasis on
modernization and improvement of the industrial sector and accelerated growth of industry and
infrastructure. The endemic power shortages all over the country constituted a serious
bottleneck constraining industrial development.6 Accordingly, power generation projects aimed
at closing the gap between the demand and supply of power were accorded a very high priority.
Given the country's large coal resources and the shorter gestation period of thermal power
projects, it was logical to concentrate on coal-based generation. By locating the Project in Tamil
Nadu, the requisite hydrothermal power balance was provided in the state system, with a view
to optimizing the utilization of the available generating capacity. The Project was consistent with
ADB's strategic development objectives of assisting the Government's industrialization efforts
and helping remove the bottlenecks in the infrastructure, particularly in the crucial power and
transportation sectors.

15.    The Project was formulated without an ADB project preparatory technical assistance,
despite being an early loan to India. The OEM concurs with the PCR's assessment that the
plant design and engineering prepared by the domestic consultants were technically sound and
appropriate in the context of the urgent need for the additional generating capacity envisaged
under the Project to meet the power shortages and the anticipated demand growth in Tamil
Nadu.

B.        Achievements and Outputs

16.    At appraisal, the Project was expected to add, upon commissioning in 1991, two units
each of 210 MW of generating capacity and generate 2,575 GWh annually, meeting 10% of the
annual energy demand in Tamil Nadu. The Project has successfully achieved both targets,
though with major delays (para. 19). The energy output reached the appraisal target in FY1999
and significantly exceeded it in FY2000 and FY2001, as a result of high plant availability and
load factor. The auxiliary consumption and thermal efficiency have been satisfactory for the
given plant design and coal characteristics (Table 1).

    At the time of appraisal, power shortages were about 21% of the total requirement (Appraisal Report, para. 24).

C.        Cost and Scheduling

17.     The total actual project cost at completion was $469 million equivalent, comprising $176
million (37.5% of the total cost) in foreign exchange costs and $293 million equivalent (62.5% of
the total cost) in local currency costs. There was a significant underrun in the total project cost
of 25% (Table 2; for details see Appendix 1).

18.     The OEM confirms the PCR statements that significant savings resulted mainly from a
major depreciation of the rupee during project implementation, and intense competition for ADB-
financed contracts, with domestic bidders generally quoting lower prices than foreign bidders. In
addition, the interest during construction was significantly lower, as the unused ADB loan
amount of $39.6 million was cancelled in phases. Finally, the price contingencies, which were a
high $96.3 million, also contributed substantially to the cost underrun.7

19.     At appraisal, the commissioning of units 1 and 2 was scheduled for March and
December 1991, respectively. Several factors led to significant delays: land acquisition
problems; procurement delays in the award of contracts (due to excessive time taken by TNEB
for bid evaluation, lengthy internal approvals of contract awards within TNEB, and additional
lengthy process for approval of awards by the Central Electricity Authority and the Government

    projects, price contingencies are calculated on the assumption of a constant real exchange rate, and come out
    much lower.

of Tamil Nadu [GTN] before submission to ADB for approval); and delays in the implementation
of some contracts, particularly that for the internal coal handling system (ICHS).

20.    Units 1 and 2 were eventually commissioned in October 1994 and March 1995,
respectively, more than 3 years behind schedule. However, their optimum utilization was not
possible due to the delay in the commissioning of the ICHS, which became fully operational only
in June 1999.8 Thus, the total delay in project implementation was about 6.5 years. The actual
implementation of the various project components, compared with appraisal schedule, is in
Appendix 2.

D.        Procurement and Construction

21.     Following its internal procedures, TNEB engaged an experienced domestic consulting
firm for engineering, preparation of technical specifications and bid documents, bid evaluation,
and review of construction drawings and operation and maintenance manuals. The consultants
performed the assigned tasks professionally and in accordance with their terms of reference.
Equipment financed by ADB was procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for
Procurement. Civil works and other contracts not financed by ADB were procured in accordance
with TNEB's procedures. TNEB reported that the performance of all contractors, except that for
the ICHS, had been generally satisfactory and that all the goods and equipment procured met
the required specifications.

E.        Organization and Management

22.     At the time of appraisal, ADB considered TNEB a mature utility possessing the requisite
managerial, technical, and financial capability to plan and implement its investment and
operation programs effectively. The only two matters for concern were (i) the tariff subsidies,
particularly in the agricultural sector, and their adverse impact on the financial viability of TNEB;
and (ii) the high power transmission and distribution losses, which stood at 22% at the time of
appraisal.

23.     The PCR presented a thorough analysis of the compliance with the 26 loan and project
covenants (PCR, Appendix 9). The OEM concurs with the PCR's observations. While TNEB
complied with most of the key covenants, it did not maintain tariffs at a level to achieve a surplus
of at least 3%, as required under Section 59 of the Electricity Act. It could achieve the 3%
surplus only through major subventions provided by GTN.

24.      As required by the Project Agreement, TNEB also conducted two technical studies, one
for upgrading the distribution system of Greater Metropolitan Madras and the other for defining
the system and identifying the equipment required for upgrading the load dispatch center for
efficient system operation and load management. Based on these studies, TNEB prepared the
feasibility report for the Madras City Augmentation and Upgradation Project (MAUP) for which
ADB provided $50.6 million under the follow-on project (footnote 2).


8
    The ICHS contract comprised coal handling plant, and dust extraction and ventilation systems. The domestic
    contractor awarded this contract performed unsatisfactorily with serious delays in implementation. TNEB
    terminated the contract in February 1997 and completed the works in June 1999 with its own resources and with
    the support from ADB's subsequent project (footnote 2). In the meantime, until the ICHS's commissioning,
    suspended particulate matter in the air and suspended solids in the run-off water around the coal handling area
    exceeded the limits specified by TNPCB. The external coal handling system for transporting the coal from Ennore
    port to the Project's coal yard was completed under the subsequent project in January 2002.
                                                                                             7

                           III.     ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT PURPOSE

A.        Plant Performance

25.      The Project enabled TNEB to optimize the operation of its hydropower generation
facilities. Until the commissioning of the ICHS in June 1999, the plant performance suffered. For
example, the heat rate (in kilocalories per kilowatt-hour [Cal/kWh]) was 3,057 in 1995, 2,683 in
1997, and 2,563 in 1998. Once the ICHS was commissioned, the heat rate improved further to
2,550 Cal/kWh. Since then, the two units have been performing very well with plant load factors
exceeding 80%. The TNEB staff for plant operation and maintenance have been adequately
trained. With the commissioning of the external coal handling system in January 2002, the
availability of coal is expected to further improve. The coal delivered by sea will be also cheaper
than that delivered by rail.

26.      The additional capacity provided and the energy generated by the plant have resulted in
an increase in consumption by domestic and industrial consumers, mainly in the urban areas in
Chennai. TNEB reported that, in FY2002, 2,566 GWh were distributed as a result of the Project.
Domestic, industrial, and commercial consumers accounted for a total of 89.9% of the energy
distributed,9 agricultural consumers who received free electricity for 4.1%, and the balance of
6.0% was used for public buildings and street lights.

B.        Performance of the Operating Entity

27.      The key indicator of the financial performance of TNEB is the 3% surplus required under
Section 59 of the Electricity Act. The Loan Agreement stipulated that TNEB would maintain
tariffs at a level to achieve the 3% surplus. However, given GTN's decision to give power free of
charge to agricultural consumers, this was not possible, and hence subventions were needed
from GTN to achieve the stipulated surplus. The OEM concurs with the PCR that such
subventions have become a significant burden on GTN's budgetary resources. Although the
subventions decreased in relative terms from 34% of TNEB's energy sales revenues in FY1991
to 23% in FY2001, they increased in absolute terms from $2.7 billion to $3.9 billion during the
same period (and much more in local currency [Appendix 3]). The financial viability of the state
electricity boards (SEBs) in India is a key issue (para. 46).

C.        Economic and Financial Reevaluation

28.    The economic and financial reevaluation has been carried out by the OEM with the world
price numeraire in FY2001 constant prices. Data for energy generated, auxiliary consumption,
and fuel consumption for the period up to FY2001 are as recorded at the power plant. Total
sales have been derived by deducting from the energy generated auxiliary consumption, and
transmission and distribution losses. Category-wise, sales have been computed based on the
percentage share of incremental sales in each year. Financial revenues for the period until




9
    The breakdown was domestic, 55.4%; industrial, 19.0%; and commercial, 15.5%.
     8

FY2001 are based on actual average realization of revenue for each category.10 For the period
thereafter, FY2001 figures have been assumed. In the economic analysis, the benefits to
consumers have been estimated using the methodology from a recent operations evaluation
report.11 The details of the analysis are in Appendix 4. On this basis, the economic internal rate
of return (EIRR) is 14.2%, and the FIRR is 8.4%. The PCR estimate of the FIRR was 4.0%. It
was significantly lower than the appraisal estimate of 7.4%, because of the long delays in
project implementation and lower revenues. In the PCR, the revenues were estimated using the
actual average tariffs in FY1999, which were higher in local currency terms than the average
tariffs assumed in the Appraisal Report, but significantly lower when expressed in dollar terms
because of the Indian Rupee depreciation.12 The OEM's FIRR estimate is higher than both the
appraisal and PCR estimates. The two main reasons for the higher FIRR are the capital cost
underrun of 25% and the higher-than-expected levels of generation.13 These factors have more
than compensated for the delays in implementation. In addition, agricultural consumers who are
given electricity free of charge by GTN consumed only a small portion of the incremental energy
generated by the plant.14 If the agricultural consumers were charged at the cost of supply, which
is the amount reimbursed through the subventions by GTN, the FIRR would be even better at
9.9%.15

D.       Sustainability

29.    Technically, the design of the Project and the technology adopted are robust and
appropriate to the available human resources and institutional capabilities. Future funding for
the required operation and maintenance is not expected to be a problem. Thus, the OEM has
confirmed the likely long-term sustainability of the Project, on the condition that GTN would
provide subventions until agricultural consumers are charged for electricity.

                   IV.      ACHIEVEMENT OF OTHER DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS

A.       Socioeconomic Impact

30.    The OEM confirmed the PCR statements that resettlement and rehabilitation efforts were
in keeping with India's prevailing standards. The OEM also investigated the PCR's points on how
these resettlement and rehabilitation measures fared with respect to ADB standards, noting that
the Project was implemented before ADB adopted the Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.16 The
OEM found the measures generally satisfactory (Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix A).
Acquisition of land for the Project affected 1,010 families in three villages and a few rural
10
   GTN provides subventions to TNEB to cover the cost of supply for the electricity consumed by agricultural
   consumers. This has not been included in the revenues. The Appraisal Report and the PCR recorded that the
   subventions have not covered all the financial losses incurred by TNEB because of the distribution of free power to
   agricultural users. Moreover, there is no contract in written form between GTN and TNEB assuring the level of
   subventions.

   PE 524: Rayalaseema Thermal Power Project (Loan 988-IND) circulated in June 1999.
12
   For example, for the domestic consumers, the PCR used Rs0.75/kWh ($0.017/kWh), while the Appraisal Report
   assumed Rs0.55/kWh ($0.044/kWh).
13
   The actual plant load factor in 2001 was 89.4% for unit 1 and 82.3% for unit 2 while at appraisal and in the PCR,
   the generation level was assumed at 70.0% of the plant load factor for both units.
14
   Agricultural consumers accounted for about 30% of the overall sales in Tamil Nadu in 1986 (Appraisal Report,
   para. 114), and about 35% in FY2001. The OEM observed that the energy generated by the plant essentially met
   the increasing demands of domestic and industrial consumers.
15
   The OEM also reaffirmed the conclusion in the previous operations evaluation report (footnote 11) that charging the
   agricultural consumers would reduce the burden on GTN to provide subventions and ensure the long-term financial
   sustainability of TNEB.

   IN.105-99. Policy on Involuntary Resettlement: Report to the Board of Directors, 30 March.
                                                                                             9


settlements. TNEB provided employment to one person in each displaced family; these families
highly appreciated such compensation. The resettled areas and amenities provided by TNEB
were also of a good standard, especially when compared with the original sites that the displaced
families used to occupy prior to the Project. This condition was particularly seen in one village
near the power plant, Athipathu, where initially 475 displaced families were accommodated. It has
attracted others and currently the population has expanded to more than twice its original size.

31.     However, as the new sites have grown, the people living there have started to make
demands for more job opportunities and other social services. Such services have grown
beyond the originally envisaged responsibility of the power plant under the resettlement plan.
TNEB has recruited a sociologist and an environmental engineer as permanent staff to deal with
these issues. The sociologist has planned routine programs on related social matters, such as
education, public health, and income generating programs. The OEM suggested working closely
with the community, social workers, and concerned nongovernment organizations in designing
and implementing these programs to ensure ownership, continuous support, and sustainability.
The OEM also suggested that the power plant open its facilities such as clinic and school to the
displaced families to create a good relationship and mutual respect, and erase unnecessary
suspicions between the people and the power plant. This approach has proven successful in a
neighboring power plant, and the OEM recommended that the lessons learned from this
success could be adopted. GTN and TNEB welcomed these suggestions and intend to
incorporate them in their social programs.

B.     Environmental Impact

32.      The OEM conducted detailed studies to review the environmental impact of the power
plant. The OEM observed that the plant is meeting environmental standards for emissions and
ash disposal (Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix B). The temperature rise in the cooling
water is also within the prescribed limits. Nonetheless, TNPCB has not yet given its approval for
plant operation because TNEB is discharging the cooling water into Buckingham canal instead
of Ennore creek as was originally licensed. TNEB had in fact already constructed the requisite
facilities for the discharge of the cooling water into Ennore creek. However, it is discharging the
water into Buckingham canal in view of the opposition of the local fisherfolk who are concerned
about the impact of the hot water being discharged into the Ennore creek on the fish there. In
the OEM's view, the current practice does not constitute an environmental hazard as relatively
cleaner, filtered seawater is discharged into a canal, which receives effluents and solid waste
from urban areas in Chennai. TNEB is resolving this matter in consultation with TNPCB. The
OEM was informed that TNEB is now preparing an $8 million project for intake and discharge of
cooling water near Ennore port.

C.     Impact on Institutions and Policy

33.    The Project did not have any significant impact on TNEB as an institution nor on GTN's
power sector policies, as none was specifically envisaged during appraisal. The institutional
impact of the Project was also limited, due to rapid turnover of project personnel.

34.     MAUP was successfully completed with ADB assistance under the follow-on project
(para. 24). MAUP has led to significant benefits such as more effective load management,
improved and balanced loading of the distribution system, reduced fault location time, reduced
restoration of supply time, reduced time of changeover of supply in the 33 kV network, and
     10

lower distribution system losses.17 The reliability of supply has also resulted in an increased
number of industrial users, and has contributed to overall industrial development in Tamil Nadu.

                                     V.      OVERALL ASSESSMENT

A.         Relevance

35.    At appraisal, the Project was consistent with the Government's priorities for industrial
and infrastructure development, and was in line with the strategic objectives of ADB's country
operational strategy. The Project continues to be consistent with the country's priority both for
economic development, for which adequate power supply is a key input, and for infrastructure.
Accordingly, the Project is rated highly relevant.

B.         Efficacy

36.      The Project successfully installed an additional 420 MW of power generating capacity
utilizing domestic coal, although the coal handling systems became fully operational only under
the follow-on project (footnote 2). The Project is, therefore, rated efficacious.

C.         Efficiency

37.    Apart from providing additional generating capacity, the Project enabled TNEB to
operate its largely hydro-based system optimally by providing the requisite thermal backup. The
EIRR is 14.2% and the FIRR is 8.4%. The Project is rated efficient, considering the long delay in
implementation.

D.         Sustainability

38.    The technology adopted for the Project is well proven and TNEB has adequate skills and
organization to operate the power plant and the associated infrastructure efficiently over its
economic life. Future funding for required operation and maintenance is not expected to be a
problem. Accordingly, the sustainability of the Project is rated likely. However, the rating is
contingent on GTN providing the subventions until the reforms in the electricity sector in Tamil
Nadu allow TNEB to charge agricultural consumers for electricity.

E.         Institutional Development and Other Impacts

39.     At the time of appraisal, no specific targets for institutional development or other impacts
were envisaged. MAUP, as formulated under the Project, achieved significant impacts in terms
of capacity building, although it was implemented under the follow-on project. Overall, the
Project's institutional development and other impacts are rated moderate.

F.         Overall Project Rating

40.   The Project has satisfactorily achieved its objectives, though the delay in its
implementation was significant. The FIRR is higher than envisaged during appraisal and


17
     TNEB's transmission and distribution losses have been reduced from 22% at the time of appraisal to 16% in
     FY2002, well below the national average of 26% (Source: Annual Report 2001-2002, Ministry of Power,
     Government of India).
                                                                                                                11

calculated in the PCR. The issues relating to the environment have been addressed adequately.
Overall, the Project is rated successful.18

G.         Assessment of ADB and Borrower Performance

41.     ADB's performance was highly satisfactory. During implementation, ADB closely
monitored progress, regularly fielded review missions, and provided valuable assistance in
resolving conflicts with some of the contractors. ADB also followed up on outstanding issues
during the implementation of the ICHS.

42.     Both the Borrower and TNEB performed satisfactorily. TNEB in general proved to be a
technically competent organization. However, its internal procedures for bid evaluation and
contract awards led to considerable front-end delays, which could have been avoided through
rationalization of the relevant systems and procedures. Also, for historical reasons, the turnover
of project personnel was high and resulted in poor ownership. TNEB also needs to improve
plant safety to meet international standards.

H.         Power Sector Policies

43.     The Project did not have any policy component. Several encouraging steps have been
taken recently by the Government and the state governments to reform and restructure the
power sector. In particular, the distribution subsector has now been targeted for improvement.
During a conference of the Chief Ministers held on 3 March 2001, many state governments,
including GTN, agreed that:

           (i)      there is an urgent need to depoliticize power sector and tariff reforms and speed
                    up their implementation;

           (ii)     distribution reforms need to be carried out by making energy audits effective,
                    developing effective management information systems, and eliminating energy
                    theft;

           (iii)    commercial viability in distribution is to be achieved in 2­3 years by creating
                    profit centers, privatizing, and/or handing over local distribution to Panchayats
                    (local bodies)/franchisees or user associations; and

           (iv)     the state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) are to be made functional
                    and tariff orders are to be issued; subsidies are to be given only to the extent of
                    the Government's capacity to pay them explicitly through budget provisions.

44.     As regards regulation, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, formed under the
provisions of Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act 1988, was made fully functional in 1999.
As of FY2001, 18 states, including Tamil Nadu, have either constituted or initiated action for
constitution of SERCs. Under its accelerated power development program announced in 2001,
the Government is also giving financial assistance, channeled through the Power Finance
Corporation (PFC), to the states for system improvement if they are implementing reforms in
their distribution systems. While the above steps are in the right direction, more needs to be
done, and done quickly. One option is to divide the distribution systems in the SEBs into small
manageable segments and to privatize them. The process could start with privatizing billing and

12

collection so that there is an immediate increase in the revenues of the cash-poor SEBs.
Overall, these developments provide a unique opportunity for ADB to take a lead role and assist
India's power sector with technical assistance and loans in restructuring and privatizing the
distribution subsector.

45.    As regards the coal sector, no significant reforms have been implemented nor
contemplated. As highlighted in previous ADB evaluation reports in the power sector in India,
there are great concerns regarding the poor quality of the coal being mined. The Government
has recognized these concerns by accepting that in future, imports of coal for coastal thermal
power stations and of oil or natural gas for inland stations will be unavoidable.

                   VI.     ISSUES, LESSONS, AND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

A.     Key Issues for the Future

46.      Financial Viability of SEBs. The financial viability of SEBs is of national relevance. Two
major factors contributing to the poor state of SEBs' finances are the politically driven tariffs and
inefficient meter reading and bill collection. As regards the tariffs, competent and impartial
SERCs are essential to provide the required barrier against political intervention in tariff setting.
Further, SERCs will also make the tariff setting process transparent and provide a forum for the
SEBs and other suppliers, and their consumers to examine and discuss the appropriateness of
the proposed tariff revisions. Such a process will therefore make the tariffs more acceptable to
consumers. The problem of inefficient meter reading and bill collection can be resolved by
privatizing this area of the utility operations with suitable incentives for private contractors. Such
privatization will likely face limited opposition since the personnel affected are relatively small in
number and since most of the redundant staff are likely to find alternate employment with the
private contractors. Further, such privatization should be an integral part of the program of
breaking up the distribution system into manageable segments and privatizing them. The
creation of such profit-oriented distribution companies would have a critical impact on tariff
rationalization, as these companies would provide a strong countervailing lobby against the
farmers' lobby, which is strongly opposed to rationalization of the agricultural tariff.

B.     Lessons Identified

47.     Land Acquisition. The Project suffered severe delays caused by difficulties in land
acquisition. This problem could have been overcome by contracting out land acquisition and
making it a precondition for ADB approval of the loan or for loan effectiveness. Experience in
Indonesia and the Philippines demonstrates that the private sector is also effective in acquiring
land expeditiously.

48.     Turnkey Contract. A single turnkey contract would have avoided the considerable
delays experienced in the implementation of the Project resulting from inordinate delays in the
award of several contracts and coordination between them. In future projects, it is essential to
discuss and agree with the Borrower and the executing agencies, prior to ADB Board approval,
the systems, procedures, and timeframes for bidding and contracting processes for such
turnkey contracts. Such an approach would have an additional advantage of allowing for intense
scrutiny by all the concerned parties and ensuring strict compliance with ADB's Guidelines for
Procurement, particularly in view of the large value of the contract.

C.         Follow-Up Actions

49.        The OEM recommends these follow-up actions:

Action                                                            Responsibility                   Deadline

50.   For actions 1, 3, and 4, ADB's India Resident Mission is requested to monitor
implementation.




19
     Such assistance can be channeled through PFC with the privatization of the distribution systems as a precondition
     for financial and technical assistance. To qualify for ADB assistance, states would need to privatize distribution only
     in such areas where it is advantageous and practical.

                            ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL REEVALUATION

A.        General Methodology

1.      The assessment of the economic and financial viability of the Project was performed
using the world prices numeraire in domestic currency (Indian rupees) in constant FY2001
prices. To convert nontradable goods and services to economic prices, a standard conversion
factor of 0.8 was used. All incremental costs, revenues, and benefits were derived in 2001
prices using gross domestic product (GDP) deflators for India from the Statistical Database
(SDBS) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Interest during construction was excluded from
the cost stream. In addition, taxes and duties were excluded in estimating the economic costs.

B.        Generation Data

2.      Data for units generated, consumption in auxiliaries, and fuel consumption for the
Project for the period up to 2001 are as recorded at the plant. For the period beyond 2001,
generation has been computed assuming a plant load factor of 85% until 2012 and 70%
thereafter, which is in keeping with the design specifications of the power plant. Auxiliary
consumption has been computed at 9% of gross generation for the period beyond 2001.
Specific fuel consumption has been assumed to remain at the 2001 level for the period beyond
2001.

C.        Capital Costs

3.       For generation, the capital costs are based on the actual project costs on completion.
Before completion of the Project, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) also invested in
expanding transmission and distribution in urban areas. Based on the figures provided by
TNEB, the capital expenditures of transmission and distribution attributable to the Project were
estimated at 50% of generation costs. Transmission costs have been assumed to occur in 3
years, with the last year coinciding with plant commissioning. The distribution costs have been
prorated on the basis of sales to ultimate consumers and have been assumed to incur in the
first year of sales.

D.        Operation and Maintenance Costs

4.     Using figures provided by TNEB, the annual operation and maintenance costs, including
the costs of ash disposal and compliance with environmental obligations stipulated by the Tamil
Nadu Pollution Control Board, have been estimated at 1% of the capital cost for generation,
0.5% of capital cost for transmission, and 2% of capital cost for distribution. Fuel costs of coal
and oil were estimated using the respective consumption levels reported in Appendix 2. The
World Bank's Commodity Price Forecasts were used as the benchmark world price for coal, and
the economic price of the coal used in the Project was estimated using the methodology in a
recent operations evaluation report.1

E.        Sales and Revenues

5.      Total sales have been derived from the units generated net of consumption in station
auxiliaries, and transmission and distribution losses. Category wise sales have been
computed based on the percent share of incremental sales in each year. Financial revenues
are based on actual average realization of revenue for each category in the past until 2001.

    was adjusted on the basis of quality (ash content and calorific value).
20     Appendix 4


For the period thereafter, 2001 figures have been assumed. From the discussions with TNEB
and the Tamil Nadu State Electricity Regulatory Commission, the Operations Evaluation
Mission (OEM) learned that future tariffs would be regularly revised, considering the rate of
inflation and overall performance of TNEB's power plants. TNEB reported that, in FY2002,
2,566 million units were distributed as a result of the Project. The domestic, industrial, and
commercial consumers who paid tariffs accounted for a total of 89.9% of the energy
distributed. The individual consumptions were domestic: 55.4%; industrial: 19.0%; and
commercial: 15.5%. Agricultural consumers accounted for 4.1% of the incremental energy
distributed from the plant. The Government of Tamil Nadu (GTN) provides subventions to
TNEB to cover the cost of supply for the electricity consumed by agricultural consumers. This
has not been included in the revenues in the base case.

F.     Benefits

6.      In the economic analysis, the benefits to consumers have been estimated using the
methodology adopted in a recent operations evaluation report (footnote 1). For the agricultural
and some low-income domestic consumers who are not charged, the benefits have been
estimated using the resource cost savings approach. First, for each of these consumer
categories, the fuel substitution shares of incremental electricity were estimated. Second,
electricity consumption that is replacing the alternative energy was valued in terms of the cost
saved by using electricity instead of alternative energy sources. For the industrial consumers,
benefits were valued at the economic price of electricity produced by captive power plants.
The economic price of the captive power was estimated based on the actual data received
from TNEB and other published data. The commercial and domestic consumers have
increased their electricity consumption in response to the better reliability and availability of
electricity after the commissioning of the Project. For these users, the benefits have been
estimated using the willingness-to-pay approach. The benefits for each of the consumers were
valued using the respective incremental electricity consumption and the average of the
corresponding tariffs for these consumers in the with-Project and without-Project situations.

G.     Internal Rates of Return

7.      The economic internal rate of return was 14.2%; the financial internal rate of return
(FIRR) was 8.4%. Two main reasons for the higher FIRR as compared with appraisal
estimates are: (i) actual project costs on completion are lower than the appraisal estimate by
25%, and (ii) higher levels of generation compared with appraisal estimates. The actual plant
load factor in 2001 was 89.4% for Unit I and 82.6% for Unit II, while at appraisal the
generation level was assumed at 70.0% plant load factor for both units. These factors have
more than compensated for the delays in implementation. In addition, as noted above,
agricultural consumers who are given power free of charge by GTN consumed only 4.1% of
the incremental energy generated by the plant.

8.      The OEM observed that the high FIRR for the Project was also due to the fact that
incremental energy generated by the plant essentially met the increasing demands of
domestic and industrial consumers. If the agricultural consumers were charged the cost of
supply, which is the amount reimbursed through the subventions by GTN, the FIRR would be
even better at 9.9%. Agricultural consumers accounted for about 30% of the overall sales in
Tamil Nadu in 1986 (Appraisal Report, para. 114), and about 35% in FY2001. The OEM also
reaffirmed the conclusions in the earlier operations evaluation report (footnote 1) that an
overall tariff increase, achieved by charging the agricultural consumers, would reduce the
burden on GTN of providing subventions and help ensure the long-term financial sustainability
of TNEB.
