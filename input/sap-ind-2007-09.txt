                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

       The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been extensively involved in the Indian
transport sector over the past 20 years: by the end of 2006, it had made 25 loans totaling
$5.28 billion to the sector, or about one third of ADB's portfolio of public sector loans to the
country. ADB's support has gone to national and state highways, and rural roads; railways;
ports; and inland waterways. Roads and highways accounted for 75% of ADB's loan
investments in the sector. ADB also provided 27 advisory technical assistance (TA) projects for
sector restructuring, institutional capacity building, system planning, tariff setting, and asset
revaluation; and 31 project preparatory TA grants for transport project formulation. ADB has
been the lead development partner in the Indian transport sector.

         The task of evaluating the performance of this portfolio faced several methodological
and practical challenges. Only 12 of ADB's transport sector projects in India have been
completed; 11 others are ongoing. Future changes in implementation efficiency, policy, and
unforeseen events will affect the final ratings of the ongoing projects. This sector assistance
program evaluation assesses ADB's interventions in roads and railways. Ports (from which ADB
withdrew after 1997) and inland waterways (to which ADB took a hesitant approach before its
exit in 2006) are analyzed only briefly in an appendix. Projects and subsectors are rated on the
basis of validated project completion reports, project performance evaluation reports,
discussions with officials of ADB and the Government, field visits, and interviews with
stakeholders. This report is based on facts drawn from close consultations with the Government
officials and ADB staff.

Demand for Transport Infrastructure

         Poor infrastructure, particularly in the transport sector, is widely recognized as a major
constraint on sustained, rapid economic growth in India. The Government is making a massive
effort to expand and improve the transport network to meet the high demand, but the billions of
dollars needed exceed its funding capacity. Private investment must, therefore, complement
public funding. Appropriate governance systems need to be put in place to build an enabling
framework for the private sector. While recent experience shows that the private sector has
responded to some projects under the National Highways Development Program (NHDP), the
private sector has been less interested in projects in which there are concerns about financial
viability or where it lacks experience in implementing public-private partnerships.

ADB's Strategy and Assistance Program

         ADB's assistance has been aimed at helping the Government address the country's
transport needs. At the beginning of lending to India in 1987, ADB placed emphasis on
transportation systems and infrastructure. The loans approved in this period supported
improvements in India's road, rail, and port transport networks, and in operating systems. In the
early 1990s, ADB turned to institutional capacity building, agency restructuring, and policy
reforms, including the promotion of private sector participation. Then, as the Government's
priorities changed, so did ADB's operational strategy, reflecting the urgency of removing
infrastructure bottlenecks and augmenting transportation capacity to reduce poverty through
economic growth. Increasingly, too, ADB advocated ways of dealing with the related social
issues (e.g., HIV/AIDS, trafficking of women and children, road safety, public awareness),
although this focus was generally not reflected in the project implementation. This evaluation
rates ADB's transport sector assistance to India from the strategic point of view by looking at
iv


sector positioning, quality at entry, value added, contribution to development results, and ADB's
overall performance.

        Some transport projects exhibited weaknesses in quality at entry. Development
objectives were poorly defined, and capacity building was not given enough attention.
Developing a realistic reform agenda for state roads and railways that the Government could
lead and ADB could support has been a challenge. ADB's projects included broad reforms that
were less realistic, and had to be fine-tuned during implementation.

        The Government has criticized the application of ADB's environmental and social
safeguards in the transport sector as involving high transaction costs and contributing to
implementation delays that offset potential benefits. Unfamiliarity with ADB's requirements,
lengthy litigations, conflicts with local laws and procedures, and duplication of activities have
been attributed as the underlying problems. Hence, government officials and ADB staff tend to
avoid projects with significant environment or resettlement issues. Such sensitive projects are
locally funded and apply domestic safeguard systems. In the process, overall development
effectiveness suffers, and ADB's position as a trusted development partner in designing and
implementing complex projects is diluted.

          ADB contributes to development results through a combination of policy and project
initiatives. Its strategy of selecting projects in relatively poorer states is appropriate. ADB's
transport portfolio has helped remove bottlenecks and has enabled broad-based economic growth
and job creation. These are prerequisites for reducing poverty. Moreover, ADB has coordinated
with other development partners as needed. Formal and informal coordination meetings with the
World Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation were less frequent in the past, but
have become more regular now, especially during country programming missions. The recently
begun tripartite portfolio review meetings between ADB, the Ministry of Finance, and
implementing agencies are seen as effective in addressing implementation bottlenecks.

Strategic Assessment

         ADB's support to India's transport sector has been relevant to the country's needs. The
interventions address national and state concerns. The evaluation found that (i) ADB's strategic
positioning and selection of priority areas are significant and appropriate to the country's needs;
(ii) ADB's assistance has contributed to improving the quality of the road and railway
infrastructure; and (iii) ADB's value added is significant in promoting policy development,
institutional strengthening, private sector participation, and compliance and public awareness of
social safeguards. The main weaknesses identified are poor project design; limited enforcement
of safeguards; and lack of progress in addressing some key policy issues, particularly in the
railways sector.

Implementation of ADB-Funded Projects

       Delays in implementation are a systemic problem common to projects funded by the
Government, ADB, and other development partners. Like ADB-funded projects, World Bank-
sponsored road projects in India are similarly delayed. Contributing reasons relate to complex
Government procedures and weaknesses in the construction industry. Among the problems
faced by the Indian construction industry are the following: (i) only a handful of the major Indian
contractors can undertake large infrastructure projects, and all of these contractors have full
order books; (ii) qualified professional engineers with road and railway construction experience
                                                                                                   v


are scarce; and (iii) commercial risks, security issues, and poor living conditions make it difficult
to staff projects in remote areas.

          Roads and Highways. Only four ADB-funded roads and highways projects have been
completed; eight are ongoing. All the projects were significantly delayed at the start because of
difficulties setting up implementation units, acquiring land, and obtaining environmental and
government clearances. Implementation delays of 18­30 months, combined with delays in loan
effectiveness averaging 12 months, suggest that (i) ADB is bringing transport projects
prematurely to the Board for approval, and (ii) implementation schedules are not realistic. ADB
has recently set up a system of screening projects for readiness based on a checklist of
activities to be completed. This could help in resolving the start-up problems, although the
checklist could be further fine tuned.

       Unfamiliarity with ADB's procedures and the transition within the Government leading up
to the establishment of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) contributed to these
delays in the 1990s. But problems with procurement procedures, land acquisition, and
environmental clearances persist and continue to affect project implementation. ADB has yet to
resolve the causes of the delays in implementation and to set realistic implementation schedules.
Delays in the ongoing projects are likely to be shorter--an average of 2 years--but could be
prolonged by several unresolved implementation issues. Main factors contributing to the delays in
implementation were:
       (i)     Project preparation and administration: (a) inadequate or inaccurate project
               preparation especially detailed project reports; (b) inadequate technical
               resources in executing agencies and implementing agencies; (c) land acquisition
               and removal of encumbrances from the right of way; (d) delays in preparation
               and approval of resettlement plans; (e) unclear environmental assessments and
               lack of familiarity with the requirements of environmental safeguards; and (f) lack
               of advance procurement planning.
       (ii)    Contractors' performance: (a) lack of experienced engineering staff, both for
               consultants and contractor--this results in poor performance by an overstretched
               supervision consultant and/or contractor; (b) poor mobilization of equipment; and
               (c) cash flow problems of contractors.

        Railways. Delays in completion have extended up to 5 years for railway projects, largely
because of procurement problems. The Indian Railways was perceived to be unfamiliar with
ADB's procurement policy. This raises concerns about the adequacy of project management by
the Indian Railways as well as ADB. While both initial projects increased, the Indian Railways'
freight haulage capacity supporting the implementation of railway reforms is a key focus area of
ADB's current program with the Indian Railways. However, implementation of the reforms have
been slow and some aspects have been abandoned. Frequent staffing changes in both ADB
and Indian Railways played a part in the delays, but slow decision making and implementation
of reforms within the Indian Railways are the more deep-seated issues. Implementing structural
reforms in a large, complex organization is difficult (the Indian Railways employs 1.4 million
people), yet ADB gave inadequate value-added support in enabling the transfer of knowledge
and best practices from other countries. The implementation difficulties experienced in the
ongoing capital investment project are attributable partly to the Indian Railways and partly to
ADB.

       ADB-supported transport projects have not been efficiently implemented. Since most of
the projects are ongoing, the performance in this respect could improve if effective steps are
taken to resolve problems. But first, there must be major efforts and closer interaction between
vi


ADB and the executing agencies to identify and resolve the problems. So far, ADB's efforts
have focused more on loan approval than on good-quality project administration, i.e., on
proactively identifying and resolving problems together with executing agencies. This lack of
balance in ADB's efforts needs to be addressed to achieve better development results.

Relevance of ADB's Assistance

        The assistance to the transport sector identified in the country strategies is relevant in
maintaining focus on the priority areas defined within those strategies. This rating is based on
several factors. First, the sector strategy is consistent with ADB's overall goal of pro-poor growth
and with the country's evolving priorities. Expansion of physical infrastructure was the priority for
both ADB and the Government at the start of ADB's involvement, and the strategy and projects
at that time were in line with this thinking. Later, recognizing the growing importance of policy
changes in improving the enabling environment for the transport sector, ADB broadened its
focus to include institutional and policy reforms. Second, while continuing to focus on physical
infrastructure because of the comparative advantage of its assistance, ADB has adjusted the
assistance in light of the growing private sector participation. Third, coordination with other
development partners has largely dealt with the geographic distribution of project areas. While
the tripartite review meetings in recent years have been an improvement, the coordination need
to extend as well to policy and implementation issues common to the other development
partners. Overall, the performance of ADB's transport sector program in India is rated relevant.

Effectiveness of ADB's Assistance

         Roads. ADB's road assistance is targeted primarily to increase capacity. Besides the
capital investment, most of the projects have promoted private sector participation in rehabilitation
and maintenance activities. This is a positive development. The benefits from the roads and
highways projects include shorter travel times, savings in vehicle operating cost, and less
congestion. Although a traffic count survey was not part of the evaluation, outcomes were
assessed in a socioeconomic survey of a sample of projects that included national highways,
state highways, and rural roads. National highways have a larger impact on the regional economy
than on the local economy. Discussions with villagers served by the rural roads indicated that
better roads improved connectivity, i.e., better access to markets, medical facilities, and
education. Overall, the roads and highways projects are expected to increase transport capacity
as ADB intended.

        Private sector involvement in roads has been growing in the last decade. While this
growth can be attributed mostly to policy changes introduced by the Government, ADB's TA
also contributed. ADB's projects have assisted in setting up the NHAI, promoting build-operate-
transfer contracts, and supporting Indian financial institutions in lending for privately-financed
infrastructure projects.

         Railways. ADB's assistance in the early 1990s generally helped to increase the capacity
of rail infrastructure and, hence, railway revenues. Although there were limited improvements in
the 1990s, the operating performance of the Indian Railways has improved in the last 2 years.
Long-term, strategic benefits could come if ADB continues its recent initiative of taking the lead
in supporting structural reforms in the Indian Railways. However, at present, those benefits are
not certain to be achieved. Although the Indian Railways has improved its customer orientation,
increased private sector participation, and rationalized tariffs, it has a long way to go before it
can operate as a commercial entity. ADB needs to work more closely with the Indian Railways
to identify and resolve the bottlenecks in the implementation of capital investment projects and
                                                                                                   vii


institutional reforms. While reforms should be structured and implemented by the executing
agency, ADB needs to be a more proactive catalyst.

        Overall, ADB's transport assistance has been effective, but on the lower side. This is
attributed to the several shortcomings in implementation. ADB and the Government have the
opportunity to rectify the implementation issues and make the assistance more effective.

Efficiency of ADB's Assistance

         The efficiency rating for completed projects is based on their economic internal rate of
return (EIRR), and that for ongoing projects on a combination of projected and actual EIRR as
observed by the Operations Evaluation Mission (in mid-2006). Although for several projects,
actual traffic was lower than forecast, the completed projects had EIRRs higher than the
benchmark rate of 12% at completion, and are therefore rated efficient. For all ongoing projects,
the EIRRs estimated at appraisal were higher than the benchmark. Lower-than-anticipated
traffic and implementation delays, which could adversely affect the EIRRs at completion, are
common concerns. Because most of the projects are ongoing and all of them face
implementation issues, the transport sector program is rated less efficient in achieving the
objectives of the sector assistance program with the use of ADB resources.

        ADB's Medium-Term Strategy II states that, to contribute more to country outcomes, ADB
must shift from an institutional culture that gives priority to loan approval and lending volumes to a
culture where portfolio performance and contribution to country outcomes predominate. The
experience in India's transportation sector shows why this change is needed. In practice, ADB's
corporate assessment of the efficiency of its operations and the formal and informal incentives for
staff performance generally revolve around the amount of loans approved each year. This
approach does not reward efforts to improve portfolio performance. Although a good amount of
transport loans has been approved since 2001, the progress in project implementation has been
poor. Much remains for ADB to do to identify and remove the problems that delay implementation.

Sustainability of ADB's Assistance

        Roads. Inadequate funding for maintenance has been a perennial problem in India as it
has been in most other countries in Asia. In the short term, NHAI has the financial and
managerial capability to implement the NHDP and attract private sector participation. However,
its capability to effectively implement the seven stages of the NHDP needs strengthening in the
medium term, and there are major gaps in funding. For state highways, the funding needs are
relatively lower and must be met from public sector sources as well as private sector
participation. But sustainability in terms of ensuring adequate funds for maintenance remains an
issue. For the rural roads, funding inadequacies persist. The current rural roads program is
massive in scale. It is not clear how it will be supported with sufficient monetary and
administrative resources. Overall assistance to the road subsector is rated less likely to be
sustainable because of concerns related to adequate funding for operations and maintenance.

       Railways. The operating performance of the railway has improved since 2004. Gains in
operating ratio and revenues have strengthened its financial position. The improvements,
however, hide institutional deficiencies--unsustainable employee costs and high-cost
borrowings. On the operational side, the Indian Railways has been gradually losing its share of
the transport market to roads. Institutional and implementation issues reduce the likely
sustainability of the capital projects funded by ADB. The reforms begun in 2003 could address
viii


these issues but implementation has been problematic. Overall, without institutional and policy
changes, the sustainability of the railway assistance is rated as less likely.

Impact of ADB's Assistance

        Despite concerns about the sustainability of the assistance, the potential impact of the
completed projects has been modest to substantial: transport projects have contributed
indirectly to economic growth and poverty reduction. Good national and state highways support
the national and regional economies. Completed road projects, whether funded by ADB or not,
have experienced traffic growth. Better access, connectivity, and lower transport costs lead to
more livelihood opportunities. Rural roads have had a positive impact on employment
opportunities, access to credit, access to health and education facilities, farm-gate prices and
agricultural inputs, and access to urban areas. The evaluation findings suggest that the
presence of an all-weather road is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for local
socioeconomic improvements. Roads and highways, in general, are likely to have substantial
positive impacts, although the specific impact of ADB-funded projects is modest in comparison
to the overall needs of the country. In the case of railways, it is difficult to attribute specific
impacts to ADB assistance or to any single project, although ADB-funded improvements in the
capacity of the Indian Railways have had a positive impact on its ability to carry more traffic.
Overall, the potential contribution of ADB transport portfolio to socioeconomic impacts has been
modest but on the higher side.

        Technical Assistance. Advisory TA projects were clustered into five groups: (i) systems
planning, (ii) institutional capacity building, (iii) private sector participation, (iv) policy
development, and (v) safety. The completed TA projects have met with mixed success because
of their inability to mainstream new systems and adopt the resulting recommendations,
ineffective follow-up by ADB, and inadequate focus on safety. On the positive side, specific
capacity-building contributions were evident in some areas. For example, the development of
private sector participation was well supported, and there was more awareness of the need to
commercialize. However, road safety, transport regulation, and capacity building in the
construction industry needs to be further strengthened.

Performance of ADB

        The Government and its development partners have appreciated ADB's assistance to
the transport sector. However, the implementation problems have diluted ADB's position as
prime development partner. ADB has increased lending in the new millennium, but with no
complementary deployment of staff. Government agencies have commented adversely on the
quantity and quality of ADB staff. ADB needs to address these staffing issues to achieve the
desired development outcomes. Tackling the wider implementation issues that cause delays will
require a more comprehensive dialogue with the Government. Issues relating to compliance
with environmental and social safeguards, harmonization of procurement procedures, and use
of country systems need to be dealt with. Overall, ADB's performance is rated partly
satisfactory.

       ADB's assistance to the transport sector, in general, is rated partly successful but on
the higher side.

       The findings of this evaluation indicate that ADB can continue to be involved in the
transport sector if satisfactory measures are taken to learn from past experience to address the
problems that have been experienced in the transport portfolio. Continued support to the
                                                                                                                        ix


   national highways, state highways, and rural roads could be directed at lesser developed
   regions such as the northeastern states. Because of the positive development impacts
   associated with rural roads, ADB needs to continue to support projects, policies, and
   institutions. The scope and degree of its involvement across the sector will be determined by the
   priorities of the Government and the results of the forthcoming country partnership strategy
   process. The following recommendations are directional and are designed to provide guidance
   for the formulation of the next India country partnership strategy and future operations in the
   transport sector.

A.        Background and Rationale

1.      Good transport infrastructure is part of the enabling environment for rapid, efficient, and
sustainable economic growth. India has an extensive and diversified transport system,
comprising 3.31 million kilometers (km) of roads, 63,465 km of rail, 12 major and 187 minor
ports, 11 major international airports, 89 domestic airports, and 14,500 km of navigable inland
waterways. The transport sector in India expanded in the first 50 years after independence, both
in spread and in capacity. Along with the increase in quantity, there have been some quality
improvements, such as the emergence of a multimodal container transport system, a reduction
in the use of obsolete assets, and improvement in the self-financing capacity of the sector.
Despite this progress, the Government of India realizes that the country's transport system is far
from adequate in service quality, coverage, and capacity. Inadequate transport infrastructure
and services are widely believed to be a major constraint on economic development in India.1

2.       Against this background, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has consistently supported
the transport sector in its operations in India. ADB's support has covered roads and highways at
the national, state, and rural levels; railways; and ports and inland waterways. Starting with its
first road (1988) and railways (1987) loans, ADB's involvement in the transport sector has been
extensive--25 public sector loans until end-2006 totaling $5.28 billion, composing about one-
third of ADB's public sector loan portfolio in the country. The road subsector (highways, rural
roads) accounts for 75% of the transport sector portfolio. ADB has also provided funding
assistance to Indian development finance institutions to help finance private sector infrastructure
projects. ADB has approved six private sector facilities linked to the transport sector aggregating
$500 million.

3.      ADB's technical assistance (TA) grants for the transport sector amounted to $34.67 million
as of 2006. The 27 advisory technical assistance (ADTA) grants, valued at $16.99 million, were
for sector restructuring, institutional capacity building, system planning, tariff reforms, and asset
revaluation. The 31 project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) grants, totaling $17.67 million,
supported project formulation for national and state highways, rural roads, ports, and inland
waterways (for details see Appendix 1).

B.        Objective, Scope, and Methodology

4.     The objective of this sector assistance program evaluation (the evaluation) is to provide
an independent assessment of ADB's assistance to the Indian transport sector and to identify
issues and areas where ADB, the Government, the private sector, and other stakeholders could
work together more effectively to improve the effectiveness of their interventions and to achieve
development results. This evaluation focuses on road2 and railway operations.3 Urban transport
and urban roads have traditionally been categorized under urban sector development within
ADB, rather than under the transport sector; they were covered by a separate evaluation.4

5.    The evaluation examined all transport sector loans and ADTA projects over the period
1987­2005 (Appendix 1). Projects approved after December 2005 were not covered in detail as

these are in the very early stages of implementation. Besides its own assessment of TA
projects, the evaluation drew on the separate evaluation of selected PPTA projects by the
Operations Evaluation Department.

6.       In evaluating the completed projects, the Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM) relied on
postevaluation reports, desk study, and site visits,5 as well as discussions with officials of ADB
and the Government. Since construction work on most of the projects began in the early 1990s,
institutional memory and the availability of project information had limitations. The projects, in
various parts of the country (Maps 1 and 2), were difficult to access for field observations within
the limited time available for the evaluation.6 The evaluation also drew on project completion
reports and internal project documents. The findings of the relevant project completion reports
were validated through desk research. The evaluation broadly followed ADB's guidelines for
country assistance program evaluation. 7 A bottom-up evaluation of lending and nonlending
programs (mainly ADTA projects) examined their relevance, effectiveness, efficiency,
sustainability, and impact. The top-down evaluation examined the strategic performance of
individual sectors and looked at ADB's sector strategy and positioning, ADB's contribution to
development results (ADB's value added and long-term impacts, including policy, institutional,
and behavioral changes that would reduce poverty and lead to economic growth), and ADB's
performance (including responsiveness to client needs, quality of services, contribution to
country strategy, adherence to sector governance, promotion of client ownership, and donor
coordination). The evaluation was based on perception surveys and related reports. Appendix 3
gives more details of the approach, methodology, and framework of the evaluation.

7.      The evaluation had several limitations. First, only 31% of the projects have been
completed; 69% are in various stages of implementation.8 Thus, some of the analysis reflects
expectations about future outcomes, and any attempt to look into the future always involve
uncertainty. Second, since the projects are geographically dispersed, not all could be visited to
gain first-hand information. Hence, the OEM examined a sample of projects. Third, it is difficult
to separate out the performance of ADB-financed projects from the performance of transport
sector projects in general. While implementation issues can be identified, the achievement of
outcomes and impacts is usually blurred by the presence of other interventions, which
influenced the results achieved.

C.        Organization of the Report

8.       Chapter II gives an overview of the transport sector and the Government's program. This
is followed by an analysis of ADB's positioning and strategy for the road and railway subsectors
in chapter III, which also reviews the collaboration with other development partners. Chapter IV
assesses the project implementation and operations of both completed and ongoing projects,
and evaluates ADB's TA projects in the transport sector. Chapter V assesses the performance
of the sector as against the evaluation parameters. Chapter VI evaluates the quality at entry and
the institutional performance in relation to ADB's assistance projects. Chapter VII provides an
overall assessment of the sector. Finally, chapter VIII summarizes the main issues faced by the
sector in general and ADB's projects in particular and identifies several recommendations.

    Due to limited time and resources, as well as security concerns in some parts of the country, the OEM visited only
    a small sample of project sites.

                            II.     THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN INDIA

A.      Overview

9.      Three quarters of India's population lives in rural villages. In 2000, 330,000 out of
825,000 villages and habitations were without all-weather road access. The majority of the
poorly connected rural communities are in 10 states--Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal
Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.9
These states are among the poorer states in India. In 2003­2004, per capita income in these
states averaged $180, compared to $262 for the country. Economic growth and structural shifts
in the economy have increased the demand for infrastructure, especially transport, over the last
decade. A profile of the transport sector is in Appendix 4.

10.    Transport demand is driven primarily by population and economic growth. From 1987 to
2005, the population grew at an average rate of 2.3% yearly. Urbanization is increasing as more
people move to India's urban areas in search of employment opportunities. Real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth since 1990 has been consistently high, averaging 5.8% yearly. The
contribution of the transport sector to the economy is higher than the proportion of the
expenditure being used to improve and maintain the sector. In FY2002, the road sector
accounted for slightly less than 3% of total government expenditure and contributed about
15.5% of revenues. Thus, the road sector generated a large fiscal surplus.10 The share of the
transport sector in total GDP increased from 5.7% in 1999­2000 to 6.4% in 2004­2005.
However, the share of the transport sector in public expenditure increased only from 3.2% to
4.2% during the same period, indicating the inadequacy of public spending.

11.     Roads. Road transport is the dominant mode, accounting for 65% of freight movement
and 80% of passenger traffic;11 rail transport accounts for much of the rest. The road network is
divided into three categories: (i) the primary system of national highways, serving interstate
long-distance traffic; (ii) the secondary system, consisting of state highways and major district
roads carrying mainly intrastate traffic; and (iii) the tertiary system, comprising other district
roads and rural roads.

12.    The national highway, with a total length of 66,590 km, serves as the arterial network
connecting metropolitan centers and major cities. This constitutes less than 2% of the road
network but carries more than 40% of the total traffic volume. The development of national
highways has been accorded high priority in planning, and an ambitious road building plan has
been drawn up. Limited public sector financial resources are a major constraint, necessitating
the development of projects through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The district and rural
roads provide much needed accessibility in meeting local, economic, and social needs;
transporting agricultural produce and inputs to markets; and using health and educational
services.

13.    Rapid economic growth and changes in the structure of the economy have created a
growing demand for all transport services (Appendix 4). The demand for road transport has
increased faster than the demand for other modes. Future demand is expected to be strong,

growing at 1.5 times the economic growth rate for freight and two times the economic growth rate
for passenger traffic. 12 The Operations Evaluation Department findings suggest that strong
demand for transport services is a key contributor to the success of ADB-financed road projects in
the Asia and Pacific region.13

14.     The economic growth and rising incomes over the last 2 decades have resulted in
rapidly growing vehicle ownership. The increasing vehicle ownership, in turn, is a key factor
underlying the rapid traffic growth. Freight traffic increased by 138 times between 1950 and
2004, while passenger traffic increased by 167 times. 14 Not surprisingly, congestion has
increased on roads, a factor that contributes to longer journey times, higher vehicle operating
costs, higher vehicle emissions, and more traffic accidents.15 Passenger traffic is forecast to
grow annually at 12­15% for the next 5 years and for freight traffic at 15­18% (footnote 12).
This rate will create an increased demand for more and better road infrastructure.

15.     Railways. The Indian Railways owns and operates one of the largest rail networks in the
world, covering more than 63,140 route km. Passenger traffic, in terms of passenger-km carried,
increased from 66 billion in 1950­1951 to 541 billion in 2004­2005 (average annual growth rate
of 4%), while freight traffic (in terms of net ton-km) increased from 44 billion to 384 billion during
the same period (average annual growth rate of 4%). However, Indian Railways has been
unable to compete consistently with other modes of traffic. During the last 5 decades, the share
of railways in the freight traffic market fell from 89% to around 40%, and its share in the
passenger traffic market dropped from 80% to 20%.16 In 2005, the performance of the Indian
Railways improved with financial net revenues increasing from $1.4 billion in 2004­2005 to
$1.76 billion in 2005­2006. This enabled the Indian Railways to consider investing in capacity
enhancement in a more positive manner. The Indian Railway's recent turnaround is seen in the
10.1% rise in revenue earning freight traffic in 2006.17

B.       Institutional Structure

16.    Responsibilities for the transport system in India are divided between the central and state
governments. In broad terms, the central Government is responsible for railways, national
highways, major ports and international shipping, civil aviation, and national inland waterways.
State governments are responsible for state and rural roads, minor ports and coastal shipping,
inland water transport, urban transport, and trucking and intercity bus services. This division of
responsibilities is not absolute--the central Government also plays a role in coastal shipping,
motor vehicle transport, and urban transport, mainly through policy, regulations, and funding
support.

   CRIS INFAC estimates the average daily traffic volume on the national highways network to be more than
   39,000 passenger car units of motorized and nonmotorized traffic. This exceeds by far the capacity of
   15,000 passenger car units of two lane highways. Thirty-two percent of the national and state highways are two-
   lane, while more than two-thirds are still single-lane roads. The congestion levels are proportionately higher on the
   single-lane roads, causing major safety issues (Source: see footnote 14).

17.      The responsibility for each mode resides in a mode-specific ministry within the central
Government.18 Interaction among these modal agencies is limited, and each agency works within
its own area without full knowledge of its impact on the others. The allocation of responsibilities is
more complicated at the state level. State highways are built and maintained by the public works
department (PWD), and rural roads by the PWD or local government engineering department.
Traffic rules and enforcement are the responsibility of traffic police; and road vehicle registration,
permit issuance, and other road transport regulations are the responsibilities of the transport
department. Institutional arrangements for urban transport are more complicated, with many
agencies being involved, but none having overall responsibility. Weak coordination among the
large number of agencies active in the transport sector creates inefficiencies that restrict
intermodal transport planning and sector management.

C.      Transport Plans and Programs

18.     The Planning Commission recognized the inadequacies and imbalances in the Indian
transport system in preparing the 9th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (1997­2002), 19 which included a
comprehensive package of measures for addressing various issues in the transport sector. The
9th FYP emphasized the need to improve the capacity and quality of the transportation system
through technological upgrading and the development of a rational tariff and investment policy
to remove distortions in the intermodal mix. Although progress in roads and ports was adequate
during this 9th FYP, shortfalls occurred in the achievement of their physical and financial targets
as well as policy objectives of the railways. The 10th FYP (2002­2007) 20 was designed to
provide a framework for the long-term development of the transport sector and a focus on
intermodal complementarities and competitiveness. The inadequate maintenance of assets
across all transport modes was recognized as pervasive. The 10th FYP noted that although the
Indian road network is extensive, only about half of the roads are paved and only 20% of paved
roads are in good condition.21 The focus was on rehabilitation and widening of roads to ensure
all-weather operations. Appendix 4 gives more details of the 10th FYP.

19.    The Planning Commission's draft approach paper for the 11th FYP (2008­2011)
recognizes the enormous cost of developing the national highways estimated at $48.4 billion.
The focus in the earlier plan on the development of national highways and rural roads will
continue, but emphasis is likely to be given to the development of state highways and district
roads to ensure integrated development. The need for reforms to modernize the railways and
improve its services has been highlighted. While the public sector has been identified as a
source of funding, the approach paper views PPPs as a way to reduce the burden on the
government budget. Further details are found in Appendix 4.

20.     Roads. For a country of India's size, an efficient road network is necessary both for
national integration and socioeconomic development. Because of the increasing demand for
road transport, the Government initiated the National Highways Development Program (NHDP)
in 1998 (Table 1). This program has the overall goal of improving the national highway network
in a phased manner (Appendix 4). The 5,846 km Golden Quadrilateral connecting the major
metropolises of Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai was expected to be completed by

21.     The Government's programs in the last decade have focused on improving the capacity
of the national network, and have placed less emphasis on developing the state highways.
There is increasing awareness that the state governments need to give more importance to
rehabilitation and maintenance activities and to allocate more funds for road development.
Limited funding remains a fundamental issue. The state PWDs also lack adequate capacity to
plan a rehabilitation and maintenance program. To address the funding issue, the Government
allocated $3.32 billion for the 12th Finance Commission,22 which distributes national revenues
among the states.

22.     The Prime Minister's Rural Road Program (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
[PMGSY]) was launched in October 2000 to improve connectivity by building all-weather roads
to the unconnected communities in the rural areas. The goal was to cover about
50,782 habitations with a population of 1,000 and above in 3 years (2000­2003). Thereafter, all
unconnected communities with a population of 500 persons and above were to be covered by
the end of 2007. For the hill states and the desert areas, the objective was to connect
communities with a population of 250 persons or more.23 This program was conceived as a
centrally-sponsored scheme in its entirety with support from international development partners,
including ADB. However, implementation has been slow, and the program has fallen short of its
targets. The progress in length of roads completed was less than 23% of the target by the end
of 2003. By the end of 2006, just 30% of the target had been achieved. To address these delays
and to provide a more focused approach, the Bharat Nirman Program was launched in 2005.
This was to provide road connectivity to 38,484 villages with populations of 1,000 and above,
and to 20,867 habitations with populations of 500 and above in the hilly and tribal areas. This
program also has other infrastructure components related to telephones, electricity, irrigation,
water supply, and housing.

23.    Railways. To improve its freight services, Indian Railways has recently begun building
dedicated freight corridors running parallel to the existing network between Delhi and Mumbai

22
     For expenditures during the period 2006­2007 to 2009­2010.

     The hill states included North-East, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Uttaranchal. The desert
     areas included Rajasthan.
                                                                                                                  7


on the western side, and between Delhi and Kolkata on the eastern side. Totaling about
10,000 km, these dedicated freight corridors are likely to cost more than $15.4 billion and will be
implemented over the next decade. The scale of these corridors is massive, requiring the
resolution of contractual, operational, technical, financial, environmental, and land acquisition
issues. ADB has been working closely with the Government and other development partners,
particularly Japan, to support this initiative.

D.         Private Sector Participation

24.      The recognition by the Government that the transport sector needs to be self-financing
as far as possible has been taken up by the transport agencies in various ways. An improved
enabling environment for the private sector has facilitated the flow of private investments into
planned programs for expanding system capacities, reducing bottlenecks, and satisfying user
demand. The most advanced private sector participation programs are in the highway and port
sectors, with the rail private sector participation beginning to progress as part of several recent
initiatives.

25.     ADB has supported private sector participation by providing TA to the National Highways
Authority of India (NHAI) and funding assistance to private or semigovernment organizations
like the Industrial Finance Corporation of India, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services,
and Industrial Development Bank of India for onlending to the private sector. These loans have
financed some transport sector projects. A recent evaluation24 raised a combination of project
design and implementation issues similar to those for public sector projects (Box 1).

                Box 1: Findings of Evaluation of Private Sector Infrastructure Facility

There has been a positive response from the private sector (largely domestic) to National
Highways Authority of India projects, although the progress of the projects varies from state to
state. The completed Asian Development Bank-financed projects have brought out several
issues: (i) lack of realistic traffic assessment, resulting in a traffic risk that is being borne by
private developers; (ii) delay in land acquisition, resulting in implementation delays;
(iii) resistance to tolls; (iv) need to structure and select the right model of public-private
partnership; (v) limited domestic capacity to cope with the huge requirement for private sector
participation; (vi) limited interest shown by international developers and investors; and (vii) lack
of innovative financing structures that suit the requirement and revenue profiles of public-private
partnerships in the road subsector.

26.    Roads. ADB TA to NHAI has supported various forms of private sector participation for
NHDP I and II revolving around the build-operate-transfer (BOT) concept. NHAI uses two basic
forms of BOT:
       (i)    Toll-based contract. The concessionaire builds and maintains the project road,
              and generates revenues from vehicle tolls during the concession period of 20­30
              years. The concessionaire also assumes the traffic risk.
       (ii)   Annuity-based contract. The concessionaire builds and maintains the project
              road, and is paid a semiannual charge by NHAI, which assumes the traffic risk.

8


27.     NHAI is proceeding on the assumption that the projects under NHDP III (10,000 km) and
25% of the projects under NHDP IV (5,000 km) will be developed on a BOT toll basis, and 75%
of NHDP IV projects will use BOT annuity contracts. These plans still have to be approved by
the Government. BOT toll contracts are planned for phases V­VII. The Indian financial sector is
supportive of the NHDP and confident in NHAI's ability to develop the projects and manage the
large projects and consortia involved. A combination of factors, including the lack of familiarity of
both NHAI and private sector participants with the BOT concept, led to some problems in the
early BOT projects. Costly lessons have been learned.25

28.      An updated Model Concession Agreement to facilitate private sector participation with
industry stakeholders in the NHDP is being developed by NHAI and is expected to be completed
in 2007. A total of 43 new BOT projects across phases I­III have been awarded by the Ministry of
Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways. Clearly, NHAI has made significant progress in
improving the enabling environment for the private sector in the road subsector. Other countries
could learn from this successful experience since, worldwide, there has been limited success in
attracting private capital into the road sector.

29.     Since not all the road projects are financially viable, NHAI intends to provide viability gap
funding, which will be limited to compensating for the revenue shortfall between the expected
and the actual rate of return of a project. The time and amount of the grant disbursement (up to
40% of the capital cost) will vary from project to project. For the first round of projects, the
available funding from the road cess26 should be sufficient. The 40% limit, however, might not
attract adequate private sector participation in remote areas. Projects in such areas will require
a combination of public sector financing and support from development partners.

30.      In the states, private sector participation is the vehicle of choice for the Maharashtra State
Road Development Corporation and Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation. Both
have attracted private sector participants in BOT annuity projects, as well as toll projects for state
highways with generally successful results. In remote areas (e.g., in Chhattisgarh), roads are not
financially viable since the traffic flows are low and risks are high for private sector investors. The
OEM visited an operational bridge (BOT toll), a state highway under construction (BOT toll), and
an urban bypass (early BOT annuity) in Maharashtra. At the bridge site, the OEM observed
relatively low total traffic flows, but a high percentage of trucks, thereby making the BOT scheme
viable since the tolls for trucks are considerably higher than those for passenger cars. Both the
bridge and approach roads appeared to be well managed and maintained; the BOT operator was
using computer technology and cameras to monitor toll collections, thereby ensuring the accuracy
of the charges levied on users, and reducing the possibility of corruption through revenue leakage.
The involvement of the private sector has enabled efficient management of the project after
completion--although not in the case of a project in Chhattisgarh. Despite private sector
responsibility for the rehabilitation and maintenance of state roads, the pavement was found to
be of inferior quality.

31.     Figure 1 shows the PPP contracts across the various subsectors as of the end of 2006.

into roads and railways. India, in contrast, has clearly succeeded in attracting private sector
investment in both roads and ports.

32.     Railways. Private sector involvement in railways has been limited. The Indian Railways
has taken several steps, with varying degrees of success, to involve the private sector in the
development of railway infrastructure and services, including the "own-your-own-wagon" and
"build-own-lease transfer" schemes. Under the former scheme, private sector firms were
expected to procure their own wagons and lease them to the Indian Railways on a charge-out
basis. The scheme was conceived to enhance the capacity of railway transport and to meet the
interests of the various sections of the economy by encouraging private parties to own their
wagons and supplement the resources of the railways for the acquisition of rolling stock. The
response was quite encouraging in the 1990s, but interest has since waned and the scheme
has been replaced by the wagon investment scheme (Appendix 4). The build-own-lease-
transfer program was designed to bridge the gap between the Indian Railways system
requirements and available funds by inviting private sector financiers to participate in the
development of rail infrastructure, including electrification, gauge conversion, and doubling of
railway line projects. The program did not succeed in attracting the private sector since the
projects faced higher risks of time and cost overruns, and there were no tax incentives for the
infrastructure developer.

33.    Consistent with experience worldwide, private sector participation in the railway
subsector in India has yet to gain popularity. The Indian Railways has recently identified the
major obstacles to private sector involvement and defined the objectives of such participation
more clearly. It plans to use a number of models to enhance its capacity and improve its
services: (i) a special-purpose vehicle, involving various stakeholders, including state
governments; (ii) BOT; (iii) private freight terminals; and (iv) wagon investment scheme. To date,
ADB has had little involvement in assisting the Indian Railways in developing its private sector
strategy. However, under the TA on Management Consulting Services to Indian Railways, there
may be opportunities to add some value in this area. Appendix 4 gives details of these plans.

E.     Regional Economic Cooperation

34.     Transport is an important element of many regional economic cooperation initiatives
involving India. In 1996, four members of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation--Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal--formed the South Asian Growth
Quadrangle, an economic cooperation initiative supported and facilitated by the South Asia
Subregional Economic Cooperation program, which was launched in 2001 with ADB assistance.
This program, supported through a series of TA projects, provides a forum for the four countries
to discuss, identify, and prioritize subregional cooperation projects in six sectors: transport;
energy and power; environment; information and communications technology; tourism, trade,
and investment; and private sector cooperation. These efforts, however, have not yet led to any
investment projects for subregional transport development. Appendix 4 elaborates on the
potential for regional cooperation in the transport sector in South Asia.

        III.        ADB'S STRATEGIES FOR THE ROAD AND RAILWAY SUBSECTORS

35.      This chapter analyzes the relevance of ADB's strategies in the context of the development
challenges facing the Indian transport sector. It uses several criteria to evaluate the positioning,
responsiveness, coherence, comprehensiveness, and harmonization of ADB's sector assistance
program (Figure 2). The evolution of ADB's transport strategy in India and the appropriateness of
its positioning, safeguard strategies, sector governance, and coordination with other development
partners are discussed in this chapter. The other top-down indicators--quality at entry and
contribution to development results--are discussed in chapter VI.

A.      Evolution of the Strategy and Sector Positioning

36.      Figure 3 shows the pattern of ADB transport lending since 1987. The road and highway
subsector has consistently dominated ADB's portfolio. Railway and port projects have been
financed intermittently, and ADB has not been involved in airports in India. ADB's activities in
the transport sector dwindled in the mid-1990s27 as (i) the institution structure of road subsector
changed with the establishment of the NHAI and experienced transition in the early and mid-
1990s; (ii) international assistance to the railways ceased for a period due to a lack of progress
in implementing reforms; (iii) the increased potential for private sector participation prompted
ADB and other development partners to exit from ports subsector in the late 1990s; and
(iv) India's nuclear test in May 1998, and the subsequent imposition of economic sanctions by
international donors, brought about a temporary suspension of ADB's assistance.28 Transport
sector lending increased after 2000 following the renewed focus on infrastructure development
in the country strategy and program.

37.      ADB's lending in the transport sector can be divided into three stages (Table 2). In the
first stage, ADB gained an understanding of operations in the Indian transport sector, and
executing agencies learned about ADB's policies and procedures. From 1987 to the mid-1990s,
ADB extended three highway loans 29 (for improvements in national and state highways in

several states), two railway loans30 (for operating improvements and new locomotive power),
and three port loans31 (for physical improvements at major ports). This assistance was in line
with the 1990 operational strategy for India, which focused on physical rehabilitation and
maintenance of assets. Because of the institutional transition for roads, the initial focus was
more on railways and ports. The strategy for roads placed priority on rehabilitating national and
state highways. For lack of a clear geographic focus, the road, port, and railway projects were
spread all over the country. ADB was establishing itself in the country, and its initial aim was
modest: to make more efficient use of existing capacity by rehabilitating it, rather than building
new capacity. As time went on, however, there was growing awareness of the need for policy
dialogue to initiate reforms. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund took the lead in
this area, and ADB followed. This was appropriate, given those institutions' long history of
involvement and the fact that ADB had started to lend to India only in 1987. Although the
strategy for railways included upgrading high-freight routes, ADB completed only one such
project. Overall, ADB's entry into the transport sector was cautious, and was aimed at
developing an understanding of the subsectors. Table 2 describes and assesses the evolution
of ADB's strategies.

38.     In the second stage, from the late 1990s to 2001, ADB focused on addressing the
implementation problems in ongoing projects. The 1996 operational strategy was expanded to
include policy reform components, especially for roads and highways, but these reforms were
limited to the institutional development activities needed to focus on the development of national
highways and to promote private sector participation. One of the most important changes during this
period was the establishment in 1995 of the NHAI, which supported the next series of ADB lending
14


to the Indian highway subsector. However, this assistance materialized only in 2000. The late 1990s
saw the approval of just one port project,32 reflecting the state of transition in the transport sector
and the impact of the freeze on new lending following the nuclear test. ADB opted to watch and wait
until the necessary institutional structures were put in place. Although a geographic focus was
emerging in other sectors like energy, the transport sector strategy continued to be driven by
umbrella-type projects that did not engage directly with the state governments. In the absence of
progress in the policy dialogue in the railway, ADB shifted its focus to roads and highways.

39.      In the third stage, from 2001, ADB supported the reform of transport sector policies and
institutions through five loans to NHAI, 33 one loan each in West Bengal, 34 and the Madhya
Pradesh government35 and railways. The 2003 ADB lending pipeline included 12 transport loans
for 2003­2006. This stage saw a rapid increase in the size and coverage of ADB assistance.
There was a move into new subsectors (e.g., state highways, rural roads). The move to support
state road projects directly was an important step in this strategy. So was the increase in the
size of loans, from $250 million in 1990 for the second road project to $400 million in 2004 for
the rural roads program. Combining physical investments with policy reforms and capacity
building in all the projects was a major transformation in ADB's operations in the transport
sector.

40.       In the new millennium, for the first time ADB developed a strategic approach for national
highways. The programmatic approach adopted was aimed at (i) supporting policy reforms in
the transport sector, (ii) introducing innovations in project design, and (iii) leveraging ADB
assistance through nonlending activities (TA projects). The reform actions were grouped under
(i) institutional restructuring and development, (ii) highway funding, (iii) project implementation,
and (iv) private sector participation. Future activities were to be designed as the milestones
related to the above themes were achieved. This was a positive development, designed to
contribute to the achievement of strategic development results in the future.

41.     Starting with the 2001 Western Transport Corridor Project, ADB adopted this programmatic
approach to designing loan projects. ADB, the Government, and NHAI agreed that policy reform
had to be placed within a broader thematic framework to meet the needs of the public for increased
mobility and of the economy for efficient cargo movement more rapidly than was possible through
the project-by-project approach pursued up to that point. Although this new approach was relevant
in the first few years, recent project designs indicate that ADB has basically followed the

Government's lead in deciding the nature of its assistance. For example, although private sector
participation was an important theme in the earlier projects, it was not part of the National Highway
Sector II Project, which focused more on the capital investment component. On the other hand, the
programmatic approach has been successful in catalyzing larger funding for the Central Road Fund.
The National Highway Public Private Partnership (Sector) Investment Program for NHDP III, which
is now being processed, has negligible institutional development interventions, but brings in a new
approach to private sector participation. While the programmatic approach was intended to be a
progressive mechanism for implementing ADB's strategies, it has only been partly successful in
providing consistency in project designs.

42.      Entry into the state highways sector in 2002 began in Madhya Pradesh state, where
ADB had approved a major loan for the State Public Resource Management Program.36 That
loan succeeded in creating a better policy environment for identifying, designing, funding, and
implementing transport projects in the state. ADB's involvement in rural roads was a response
to its growing focus on poverty reduction. The Rural Roads Sector I Project was designed to fit
within the nationwide program, but with a focus again on Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
The high degree of relevance of this project seems to show that ADB's overall initiatives in the
road and highway subsector are moving toward a clearer geographic focus and contribution to
poverty reduction through economic growth. Recent studies indicate a positive correlation
between rural roads improvement and poverty reduction. 37 The International Food Policy
Research Institute has found that more public spending on rural roads has the greatest impact
on poverty reduction and on productivity growth.38

B.      Environmental and Social Safeguard Strategies

43.     ADB's environmental and social safeguards in the transport sector in India are relevant
to the overarching goal of pro-poor growth. The safeguards are aimed at preventing and
mitigating the adverse impacts of projects on the environment and at ensuring that the
livelihoods of all affected persons, particularly among vulnerable groups like indigenous people,
female-headed families, and other socially disadvantaged people, are restored to at least their
pre-project levels. A recent evaluation39 found that in India and especially in the transport sector,
ADB staff and the Government officials tend to prefer projects that are less environmentally
sensitive (Box 2). While India has a well-developed and comprehensive legal basis for its
environmental safeguards, the implementation and enforcement of ADB guidelines have been
fraught by delays in project implementation. ADB has been working with the Government and
other development partners in developing environmental safeguard systems for India that are
better aligned with the country's priorities, systems, and procedures, to avoid duplicating efforts.

                Box 2: Findings of the OED Study on Environmental Safeguards

India's environmental safeguard system is stringent, perhaps even more so than the ADB system. ADB
and the Government have pursued a strategy of avoiding sensitive subprojects by picking only those
sections of roads that can be classified as "B" under the ADB classification system. This preference has
led in some cases to situation where ADB finances road sections going into and coming out of a nature
sanctuary, and leaves NHAI itself to finance the sections within the sanctuary. Getting environmental
clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests for relatively more environmentally sensitive
sections of roads would take 1­2 years causing excessive delays and higher commitment charges for
ADB-financed projects. In the case of the Loan 2019 National Highway Corridor Sector I, ADB financed
the Chittorgarth-Kota section, the edge of a gavial sanctuary, and the section starting at the other end of
the sanctuary, leaving NHAI to handle the bypass section within the Jawahar Sagar Sanctuary. The
Ministry of Finance has affirmed the Government's support for ADB's approach of avoiding
environmentally sensitive sections of roads, since doing so reduces the cost of borrowing, particularly in
the form of commitment charges and interest during construction. At the same time, however, ADB's
safeguards are apparently perceived to be difficult to implement for environmentally sensitive projects in
the transport sector.

44.    Regarding environment issues in the transport sector, the matter of vehicle emissions
has yet to be addressed by ADB. India has adopted various norms in line with the international
emission norms.40 There has been growing awareness in India of the problem of motor vehicle
emissions. Given these concerns, and the growing worldwide concerns about greenhouse
gases, ADB should make more of an effort to link policy initiatives in this area with transport
operations to ensure that this issue is effectively addressed. This issue is discussed further in
chapter VIII.

45.    India's involuntary resettlement safeguards for transport projects have not always
converged with ADB standards (Box 3). Coupled with this are administrative difficulties in
implementing ADB's involuntary resettlement policy in India--inadequate land records, lack of
experienced consultants, slow judicial system for resolving compensation disputes, and
inadequate capacity within executing agencies' for managing resettlement.41 These issues have
complicated the enforcement of the safeguards. In addition, ADB's involuntary resettlement
safeguards require ADB to perform multiple checks on resettlement planning at the India
Resident Mission and at the ADB headquarters. Executing agencies consider some of these
measures redundant and causing delays in implementation. Unlike the World Bank's Resident
Mission, ADB's resident mission is not staffed to provide the type of in-country expertise needed
to address resettlement issues during project processing or project implementation.

   manufactured on or after April 2005.

                              Study on Involuntary Resettlement

The adoption of the National Policy for Involuntary Resettlement and Rehabilitation in India in February
2004 was a major step forward from a situation where the Land Acquisition Act of 1894, amended in
1984, was the main legislation governing resettlement. However, the existing laws do not make it
mandatory to pay relocation and transfer expenses or to provide transition and livelihood support; to give
assistance to vulnerable people; to reestablish agricultural and business production; to assist in restoring
incomes; and to restore social services, social capital, community property, and resources, although all
these are partly covered by the Urban Development and Housing Act. The policy, in fact, refers mainly to
large resettlement operations, and differs significantly from the Asian Development Bank's (ADB's)
mandatory requirement to prepare a resettlement plan and special measures in case a loss of livelihood
greater than 10% is anticipated for at least 200 affected persons. Courts in India quite specifically
opposed any "reward" of assistance to squatters when they demand this, thus posing a special problem in
the application of the ADB policy.

46.      Transport projects often involve environmental and resettlement issues, so adequate
safeguard provisions are needed. This is reflected in the Planning Commission's approach paper
to the 11th FYP, which recognizes the need to develop a transparent policy rules for resettlement
compensation, to make the affected persons beneficiaries of the projects, and to give legal
standing to these rules with respect to the rights of the displaced. While this would be a step in the
right direction, the legal structure must first be streamlined so that issues like the lack of land
records are also addressed. The Government views ADB's approach to the enforcement of these
safeguards as inflexible and, in some cases, unrealistic. Administration of these safeguards is
perceived as bureaucratic, requiring several layers of approval within ADB.

47.      ADB's country strategies have increasingly focused on "inclusive social development" in
infrastructure projects, as one of the three pillars of its operations in India--along with
sustainable economic growth and good governance. Thus, the prevention of HIV/AIDS and
trafficking of women and children, road safety, and public education have become standard
mitigation measures in the design of ADB-supported road projects. It remains to be seen,
however, whether the rhetoric will be supported by adequate implementation. There has been
limited application of these measures during project implementation, as well as after project
completion. For example, an HIV/AIDS awareness campaign and human trafficking were part of
the National Highway Corridor (Sector) Project but were not effectively implemented.

48.     Project monitoring continues to focus primarily on engineering activities, principally the
review of contracts (civil works tenders and progress of road and rail improvements), and pays
limited attention to transport sector road maps (Appendix 5) and the corresponding performance
indicators agreed on between the Government, ADB, and the World Bank. These road maps
have no "social" indicators (other than reductions in traffic accidents) that would assist in
monitoring project-related benefits and help to quantify progress against the prescribed social
objectives. The indicators also do not include any measures related to institutional capacity-
building activities and their sustainability, such as acceptance and use by the executing agency
of new systems, procedures, and user manuals developed with ADB assistance. ADB must take
steps to strengthen the transport road maps, in conjunction with the executing agencies and
other development partners, to establish realistic targets, and to identify verifiable, measurable
indicators for monitoring. In addition, these road maps must be used while designing projects.

C.     Sector Governance and Anticorruption Activities

49.      Governance in the transport sector has undergone a positive change with the gradual
development of an enabling environment that allows the entry of the private sector into the
rehabilitation and maintenance of transport infrastructure. There is growing awareness that
government needs to act more as a facilitator rather than as the executing agency. This is
apparent in the evolution of NHAI from a developing and operating agency to a catalyst for private
sector participation. The Government has increasingly decentralized responsibilities in the
transport sector to encourage wider participation in decision making. The PMGSY program for
rural roads is based on a decentralized process of project identification and implementation. The
need to improve the performance of state-owned enterprises is recognized. State governments
have increasingly corporatized specific activities to make them more efficient and effective, and to
improve service delivery. The development of the Madhya Pradesh Road Development
Corporation is a step in this direction. This resulted in an examination of innovative means of
improving services, among them, customized BOT contracts that include various aspects of traffic
enforcement like axle load control. The ADB-supported Madhya Pradesh public resource
management program (footnote 36) was instrumental in establishing a policy and focused
institutional capacity for private sector participation to set the scene for the development of sector-
specific support (e.g., roads and power). This led to the enabling governance environment for
preparing a road sector development policy to improve the road network and maintenance, and
encourage private sector participation through various schemes. Other states have also been
moving in the same general direction. While the investment climate in the transport sector has
improved, much remains to be done in de-bureaucratizing activities.

50.     Corruption is another governance issue. There have been recurrent allegations of
corruption in various aspects of the transport sector, including payments to (i) secure driving
licenses without training and testing, (ii) facilitate the passage of overloaded trucks or those
without valid fitness certificates, (iii) avoid a fine for a driving violation, (iv) secure major
engineering or construction contracts, or (v) circumvent specifications during construction.
Figure 4 provides an indication of the generic incidents of corruption across the transport sector.
These activities appear to exist in varying degrees in most parts of the country. The lack of
adequate resources for curbing these activities, coupled with administrative procedures that
create opportunities for inappropriate behavior, allows these activities to continue. The
experience in other countries suggests that the use of mechanisms to encourage private sector
participation shifts the locus of corruption from public procurement to the award of franchises.

51.     ADB's Office of the Auditor General ­ Integrity Division investigated several corruption
allegations related to ongoing and completed ADB-supported transport projects in India. Key
findings of the audit were:
        (i)     In the East-West Corridor Project: Evidence of bid manipulation in the selection
                of nonqualified bidders and disqualification of qualified bidders for six packages
                in Gujarat. As a result, one firm was debarred for at least 3 years.
        (ii)    In the Chhattisgarh State Roads Project: Evidence of misrepresented information
                and actual signatories in the résumés of proposed experts. As a result, ADB
                debarred a participating firm and a proposed expert for 3 years each.
        (iii)   In the Rural Roads Sector I Project: Three supervision consultants replaced a large
                number of their experts on the project team; from 84% to 92% of the team
                composition changed after the contract award. The explanations for replacement
                were judged to be reasonable. The reasons given included, among others, lengthy
                contract negotiations and budget constraints requiring revisions in proposals and
                necessary adjustments in experts' person-months and contract price.

52.     A 2002 study by the Central Vigilance Commission reported on the specific issues facing
the construction industry at that time. These issues are relevant to the transport sector, as much
of the proceeds of ADB loans are used to finance civil works contracts. The report identified the
key problem areas of corruption in construction as "administrative approval, detailed estimate
20


and technical sanction, consultancy, preparation of tender documents, invitation and opening of
tenders, tender scrutiny and award of works, works agreement, payment to contractors, site
records, and quality in construction."42 In the case of ADB's transport projects, there are several
areas where the findings of that study could be applicable, although given the scope of this
evaluation, it was not possible to identify all the areas or to find strong evidence to support the
findings. Since the findings of ADB's Integrity Division revolve around the appointment of
supervision consultants, this is one area where ways need to be found to mitigate the risk of
corruption affecting ADB projects.

53.     Reports submitted to ADB's Board for project approval do not explicitly include specific
corruption risk mitigation measures other than standard deterrents such as using the
International Federation of Consulting Engineers (Fédération International des Ingenieurs-
conseils [FIDIC]) with typical monitoring mechanisms, explaining ADB's anticorruption policy to
the executing agency, and including relevant provisions of the policy in the bid documents. To
address corruption, ADB has largely relied on the Central Vigilance Commission, which
regularly and independently investigates possible cases of corruption. While the Central
Vigilance Commission and ADB's Integrity Division conduct audits independently, there is a
need for more proactive measures to counter the risk of corruption. The investigatory approach
could be complemented by sector work and innovations in project design that are designed to
reduce opportunities for corruption.

54.     ADB could be more proactive in finding ways to engage in this difficult area in its
operations in the Indian transport sector. The World Bank has been exploring corruption-
mitigating measures such as using "e-government" practices requiring the electronic submission
of tenders for goods and services. Other approaches that could be explored include enforcing
sanctions against guilty firms across government departments, using independent observers
from nongovernment organizations in contract award committees, developing agency report
cards, and harmonizing anticorruption efforts to mitigate the risk of corruption with those of other
development partners.

55.      ADB's Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan II43 prioritizes the identification and
implementation of measures at project entry level to reduce governance- and corruption-related
risks in the various sectors. ADB must make more effort to implement this approach in the
Indian transport sector, as not enough attention has been paid to this issue in the past.
Management and senior staff should give more guidance to ADB staff in this difficult area. After
all, strengthening anticorruption initiatives is an explicit corporate priority in the ADB's Medium-
Term Strategy II. Specific recommendations in ADB's Governance and Anticorruption Action
Plan II include (i) employing professionally recognized experts in sector governance, institutional
development, and corruption prevention; (ii) training ADB sector specialists to a level where they
can undertake institutional development and anticorruption work; and (iii) ensuring that those
recruited for the sectors in the future have institutional development and corruption prevention
skills. All these measures are relevant to the transport program in India.

D.      Coordination with Other Development Partners

56.   ADB's assistance to India's transport sector has been part of a larger assistance
program financed by several other multilateral and bilateral partners active in the sector,

including the World Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and the United
Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID). In terms of their contributions,
ADB and the World Bank have provided the most financial assistance (in about equal amounts),
followed by JBIC and DFID. Since annual donor consultative meetings ceased in 2003, the
development partners have had no formal coordination meetings. However, "frequent" informal
contacts reportedly take place "as required" and at "all levels" within the respective
organizations--involving staff at ADB headquarters and at the India Resident Mission, with their
counterpart representatives and offices of the World Bank, JBIC, and DFID.

57.     In 2001, ADB developed a coordinated assistance strategy for the road subsector jointly
with the World Bank. This was essential since ADB and the World Bank were both involved in the
national, state, and rural road improvement programs. The coordinated strategy enabled a broad
agreement on the states where ADB and the World Bank would focus their activities. However, it
did not provide much support in resolving common implementation issues. ADB and the World
Bank have been the major aid agencies for the development of the NHDP. In 2002, ADB, the
World Bank, and NHAI agreed that ADB would primarily focus its lending on the western half of
the Golden Quadrilateral, the western half of the East-West corridor, and the northern half of the
North-South corridor. The World Bank would primarily focus on the northern half of the Golden
Quadrilateral and the eastern half of the East-West corridor, and the southern half of the North-
South corridor. Currently, ADB participates in a tripartite portfolio review meeting chaired by the
Ministry of Finance and attended by all the implementing agencies. This meeting appears to be an
effective way of resolving implementation issues and reviewing project progress.

58.    Table 3 summarizes ADB's completed and ongoing involvement, compared with that of
the World Bank and JBIC. ADB is expected to fund about 20% of the first two phases of the
NHDP. However, just over a quarter of the road improvement works have been completed,
about 6% of the entire program.

59.   Table 4 gives details of donor support for the PMGSY program for rural roads in India.
ADB will fund 16.5% of the current total coverage (in km) of the program. Very few of the ADB-
funded projects have been completed. The PMGSY program is hampered by several
implementation issues (Appendix 6). These problems also affect the projects being funded by
the World Bank.

60.     The railway subsector has received considerable external support over an extended
period. The World Bank was the leading source of external assistance, providing $2.1 billion in
loans for 18 projects between 1959 and 1988. From 1988 onward, the World Bank stopped
supporting the Indian Railways, but in 2002 it approved a project to develop a separate urban
railway serving Mumbai. ADB provided railway loans aggregating $415 million in 1987 and 1991.
The leading bilateral funding agencies for railways have been Germany and Japan, which have
financed six projects each since the early 1980s. Germany's support has been mainly for the
supply of equipment and the strengthening of its production units, and Japan's support, for
urban railway systems, most recently for the construction of the Delhi metro system. Other
bilateral funding agencies include France, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Overall, until the early 1990s, external assistance financed railway investments with varying
success. After that time, external assistance was reduced as funding agencies became
concerned that investments would not achieve their potential impacts until institutional and
policy reforms were implemented to address key obstacles to sector performance. Since 2002,
ADB has taken the lead in providing assistance to the railway sector.

E.         Assessment of the Relevance of ADB's Strategies

61.     ADB's operational strategies in the transport sector have been in line with the
Government's changing development needs, both long- and short-term, during this 20-year
period. However, the formulation of some operational strategies may have overestimated the
demand for transport infrastructure;44 placed too much emphasis on civil works relative to social
systems, planning, and coordination requirements in the transport sector; and reflected an
unrealistic assessment of institutional capacity to handle the implementation activities in both
ADB and India, particularly at the state level and within the road construction industry. Despite
these weaknesses, the assistance program has been broadly relevant in addressing the needs
of the sector and in complying with ADB's sector strategies and policies.

62.      The objectives and priorities have evolved over time, in accordance with operational
strategies and policies based on perceived needs (Table 2). The focus of assistance has
broadened from just capital investment using traditional engineering, procurement, and
construction contracting to more strategic foci supported by policy reforms and institutional
strengthening in PPP, and support India's poverty reduction strategy and the Government's
initiatives in the transport sector. With the continued focus on the transport sector, ADB's

44
     This is apparent for national highways where actual traffic has been less than the appraisal forecast.
                                                                                                            23


strategy in the country has been consistent, ensuring long-term continuity and engagement in
the sector. This has enabled the evolution of better comparative assistance advantage in both
physical and policy interventions. Appendix 7 provides a more detailed assessment of the
strategic positioning of ADB and the gaps therein.

63.      Although not stated explicitly in strategy and program papers, ADB's sector goals for
India's transport sector over the past 2 decades have encompassed (i) improving infrastructure,
(ii) strengthening institutions and building the capacity of national and state transport agencies,
and (iii) supporting poverty reduction through infrastructure-led growth and spreading social
benefits to rural communities. The actual achievements are assessed in the next section with
these broad goals in mind.

         IV.      IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION OF ADB-FUNDED PROJECTS

A.      Lending Projects

64.     Only four of 15 approved road and highways projects have been completed. 45 The
majority of projects assessed were, therefore, ongoing projects (under construction at the time of
the OEM in 2006). Hence, the discussion of efficiency largely relates to implementation (project
processing and administration) efficiency as opposed to the efficiency of investment, as is typically
represented by the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). Where relevant, references are made
to the appraisal and post-completion estimates of EIRR. The assessment in this section is
designed to determine (i) the objectives ADB intended to achieve in the sector through the
projects; (ii) the degree to which ADB has achieved the objectives (or is taking an appropriate
approach in ongoing projects to help achieve them); and (iii) the internal and external factors that
affected project implementation, operations, and the achievement of the objectives.

        1.       Roads and Highways

65.     Appendix 1 lists the ADB-supported road and highway projects. ADB's support has
come in two main cycles: (i) completed projects, approved from 1988 to 1993, which focused on
improving the highway network by reducing transportation bottlenecks; and (ii) ongoing projects,
approved since 2001, which combine assistance to the central and state governments, and are
concerned with improving the national highways to remove capacity constraints and improve
road safety. Road improvements have typically involved the rehabilitation of existing roads,
rather than the construction of new ones. This was consistent across all projects.

                 a.      Completed Projects: National Highways and State Highways

66.     Four national highway loans approved in 1988­1993 (Table 5 and Map 1) were all
administered by the Ministry of Surface Transport. 46 All experienced significant delays in
implementation. These projects involved implementing agencies--PWDs from a number of
states--with little previous experience of working with international funding agencies. A common
design feature of these early projects was the geographic dispersal of subprojects all over the
country, negating any coherent effort to improve the effectiveness of institutions involved in
these interventions.


45
   One of the loans (for the Bombay-Vadodara Expressway) was canceled because of problems with land acquisition
   following a lengthy debate about alignment possibilities and options.
46
   Now the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways.

67.     Delays during implementation were caused by the time taken by executing and
implementing agencies to acquire land, relocate utilities, obtain environmental clearances, and
clear trees and other encumbrances within the defined right-of-way for the road improvements.
Other issues noted in ADB project monitoring documents included the fact that inefficiencies
occurred during the handover of responsibilities to the newly established NHAI and after that,
because of deficiencies in NHAI's project management practices, disbursement irregularities,
and inconsistencies in accounting systems. Confusion over the respective roles of "engineer"
and "employer" and the lack of experience of the executing and implementing agencies with
FIDIC conditions of contracts for roadworks caused difficulties during implementation. ADB
should have been more proactive in providing training to accompany the introduction of FIDIC
and international tendering, tender evaluation, and contract award.
68.     The civil works contracts failed to attract bids from international contractors because of
their small size. However, Indian contractors did not have enough experience with such
contracts. As a result, projects faced contractor cash-flow problems, as well as issues related to
safety during construction, slow progress of works on-site, and inadequacy of personnel. These
problems were continually discussed in ADB's monitoring reports and could not be resolved
despite reported efforts to mitigate these issues. Appendix 6 provides a summary of the
implementation performance for each of the above projects.
                  b.      Ongoing Projects: National Highways, State Roads, and Rural Roads
69.   Table 6 provides a summary of the ongoing ADB-supported projects, all of which were

70.      All the ongoing projects are characterized by implementation delays at various levels.
Common factors contributing to these delays are summarized below and discussed in greater
detail in Appendix 6:
         (i)     Project preparation and administration:
                 (a)     inadequate or inaccurate project preparation, especially detailed project
                         reports;
                 (b)     inadequate technical resources in executing and implementing agencies;
                 (c)     land acquisition and removal of encumbrances from the right-of-way;
                 (d)     delays in the preparation and approval of resettlement plans;
                 (e)     unclear environmental assessments and lack of familiarity with the
                         requirements of environmental safeguards; and
                 (f)     lack of procurement planning.
         (ii)    Contractors' performance:
                 (a)     insufficient or inadequately experienced engineering staff of consultants
                         and the contractors, resulting in poor performance by the overstretched
                         supervision consultant or contractor;
                 (b)     poor mobilization of equipment; and
                 (c)     cash flow problems of contractors due to low bid prices.

71.        To tackle the above issues, ADB has recently initiated the following measures:
           (i)    To offset delays in setting up project management units and project
                  implementation units, loan documents provide an assurance to ensure early
                  establishment of these units;
           (ii)   To offset slow procurement, advance action on pre-construction activities and
                  procurement have been made standard features on all highway projects;
           (iii)  Poor performance of contractors is being tackled by improving the
                  prequalification criteria for joint venture partners;

72.    Clearly, this is just a start and a lot more needs to be done. The above measures need
to be supplemented with further actions to tackle the specific factors mentioned above. For
26


example, the above project-readiness indicators need to be fine tuned to reflect the local
context.47

                          i.       National Highways

73.     The evaluation team visited national highway projects in Chhattisgarh that have been, or
are being developed on a BOT basis,48 without ADB assistance. The visits enabled a cursory
field assessment of evident operation and maintenance and safety benefits from private sector
involvement in these activities. A section of NH6 is being upgraded, on a BOT basis, to serve as
the southern entrance to Raipur. Inspection of the work site (both at night and in the daytime)
revealed the inadequacy of signs warning drivers of diversion schemes and construction activity.
Where the new dual carriageway has been completed (with service roads on both sides), there
was inadequate provision of safe-crossing facilities for pedestrians on an intensively commercial
section of the road. On this straight section, vehicle speeds tend to be high, yet, road signs were
inadequate. On the other side of Raipur, the evaluation team visited the Durg bypass, which
was completed in 1998 and was one of the early BOTs. The road has been maintained under
the BOT contract, but the riding surface is uneven, with signs of poor maintenance practices.
The bypass also has no centerline road marking and few traffic signs. Discussions with
concerned officials indicated that although the BOT contract was being managed by NHAI,
adequate remedial action was not taken. This underlines the institutional capacity issues faced
by the NHAI at the project level.

74.       Coordination among the various Government departments has been lacking. There is
little interaction between the NHAI and the Ministry of Rural Roads, although both national
highways and rural roads are centrally funded. In the past, there was insufficient coordination
between the NHAI and the various State Governments, causing delays in land acquisition. This
is being rectified now, although a lot remains to be done in terms of coordinating the transport
planning and construction activities.

75.     The road construction industry finds it difficult to cope with the demands placed on it by
India's extensive road improvement and network expansion program. These issues are
common across national, state, and rural roads projects, whether funded by the Government,
ADB, or other development partners. The presence of international contractors has had no
value addition since these contractors do not provide sufficient managerial, technical, and
financial inputs in the implementation. The World Bank-sponsored road projects in India face
problems similar to those reported for ADB projects. The industry, in general, faces the following
problems: (i) only five to six major Indian contractors can provide the services (including staff)
on BOT national highway schemes, and all have full order books; (ii) qualified professional
engineers with road construction experience in India are in short supply, and new graduates are
being attracted away from the industry by higher salaries in other fields, notably information
technology; and (iii) road projects in some states and in remote areas have staffing problems
because of commercial risks, security issues (some contractors have had equipment

47
   Based on the detailed design, a land acquisition plan can be prepared containing 100% census survey of all
   affected households and assets (covering both titleholders and non-titleholders), and a detailed resettlement plan
   could be prepared and made ready for ADB review. ADB can undertake the due diligence of the resettlement plan
   in parallel to the project approval. In a scenario where land has already been acquired by the executing agency in
   line with the Land Acquisition Act and in anticipation of ADB Project, there could be gaps between the ADB
   Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard policy and Government's framework. To tackle this, point (viii) in Box 3 could
   be modified to state "100% census survey of all affected people be completed and a land acquisition plan prepared
   based on the detailed design for the first phase civil works."
48
   Para. 26 gives details on the definition of BOT contracts.
                                                                                                                27


destroyed), and poor living conditions. ADB's sole intervention on this subject was an ADTA to
study the road construction industry in 1990 with the ADTA completed only in 2000. Although
the ADTA was found to be useful, ADB must provide more assistance to the industry in
institutional strengthening and capacity building.

                            ii.      State Highways

76.     The West Bengal Corridor Project, concerned with improving national, state, and rural
roads, was adversely affected by the poor performance of the project implementation unit in the
early period, problems with slow progress on civil works resulting in the termination of
contractors, and resettlement issues. The Government opted to withdraw a subproject from
ADB financing, since it intended to expand the scope of the subproject to widen the road and
the expansion was likely to raise involuntary resettlement issues. The decision to withdraw from
ADB financing was taken to ensure that the subproject was completed on schedule and without
the delays, which the executing agency associated with complying with ADB social safeguard
policies.

77.     The corollary of selecting only those projects that do not involve safeguard issues
appears to be unworkable, as seen in the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Project, where there
have been difficulties in identifying such "ideal" subprojects. Since 2002, ADB has provided a
combination of program and project loans to that state, thus serving the dual purpose of
capacity development and financing capital investments. The Madhya Pradesh project loan was
aimed at rehabilitating state highways with no safeguard issues. In other words, roads that were
environmentally sensitive or involved resettlement were specifically excluded from the scope of
ADB assistance. Although implementation was expected to speed up this way, excluding
environmentally sensitive projects is counterproductive to the development of an integrated
network. The executing agencies found it increasingly difficult to identify state roads without any
safeguard issues. This contributed to implementation delays. Such incentives, which appear to
be rational from the perspective of executing agencies and ADB staff, are unlikely to be what
the ADB Board had in mind when it adopted ADB's safeguard policies.

78.      Although Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation appears to be well organized
and is developing into an efficient road management agency as ADB envisaged when it granted
the program loan, most of its staff are merely on deputation from the PWD. This gives cause for
concern about the long-term sustainability of the organization and its new systems and
procedures. The remaining PWD organization appears to be overstaffed and had been excluded
from the initial capacity-building activities within the TA and the program.49 Another element of
concern in Madhya Pradesh is the fact that government officials have rejected the need for a state
road fund to cover road maintenance costs because (i) the Government of Madhya Pradesh is
currently providing enough funds to cover the estimated cost of state-wide road maintenance
needs; and (ii) in the past 2 years, the funds allocated for road maintenance have not been spent.
ADB's continued involvement in roads in this state needs to facilitate policy reforms and
strengthen organizational capacity to improve the sustainability of state roads and transport
agencies. A dedicated road fund would allow systematic planning and prioritization of
rehabilitation and maintenance activities in the state. While a road fund has its pros and cons, the
absence of a maintenance planning tool in the Madhya Pradesh necessitates focused
prioritization of its maintenance interventions.


49
     This shortcoming was partly rectified late in 2006 when the institutional capacity-building TA was extended to
     include the development of appropriate road management systems for the PWD in Madhya Pradesh.
28


79.    Site visits to state road improvement projects found the same set of issues seen on
national highways--poor road signs; inadequate traffic signals and barriers at construction sites;
and inadequate signals at road diversion sites, particularly at bridge and culvert works. 50
Industry guidelines and standards have been developed for the Indian Roads Congress,51 but
these are being ignored by contractors and supervision consultants.

80.      The Madhya Pradesh loan had a program component that identified several policy
actions as conditions for the release of tranches. The State Government found it difficult to
satisfy a key condition of the loan relating to the implementation of the staff rationalization
program, which was not completed. A more realistic approach based on sound analysis of a
difficult problem and considering the views of stakeholders was required. On the whole, the
design of the state roads development program could be improved, taking the realities of each
state into account.

                          iii.     Rural Roads

81.     The Rural Roads Sector I Project52 covers Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh within the
Government's broader rural road program. It is managed by the Ministry of Rural Development
and the rural road development agencies of the states, with the latter acting as executing
agencies and project implementation units. In accordance with the basic goal of the Government's
rural roads program, the project is aimed at reducing poverty and deprivation in the two states by
providing better access to markets, employment opportunities, and social services to support
economic growth. This is to be achieved by providing rural inhabitants with all-weather road
connections and improving safety on rural roads. The project scope includes the reconstruction
and upgrading of 5,500 km of rural roads in each state.

82.     There have been delays in project start-up and in the mobilization of consultants in both
states. Consultants have also reportedly changed the composition of their teams after contract
award, which affected the implementation schedules and quality of services. Although the
consultants' scope of activities includes training and awareness building among contractors and
executing agencies, there has been no evidence that this has been done. Another indicator of
the adverse impact on the quality of the consultants' outputs relates to the preparation of
estimates as part of the detailed project reports. An evaluation made by the Planning
Commission found that estimates prepared under the Government's rural roads program are on
the higher side, causing underutilization of the allocated budget.53

83.      The rural road development agency in Madhya Pradesh reported inadequate
performance by both consultants and contractors, with a lack of on-site presence by supervisory
consulting teams and any effective training of contractors, as required by the consultants' terms
of reference. Very few technical ADB missions had visited the project sites to assess the work
activities. The construction sites are poorly managed in terms of traffic signs of the works and
diversions. In addition, labor issues affecting contractor staff and other disputes were recorded
as part of the socioeconomic study conducted as part of the evaluation (chapter V and Appendix

   A sample project evaluated by the Planning Commission showed that the amount that remained unused on the
   completion of these projects varied from 6.83% to 32.19% (Source: Quick Concurrent Evaluation of PMGSY,

12). The OEM's visit to Chhattisgarh found a similar situation with overall progress even less
advanced because of issues with local contractors. Bid responses from contractors for works in
remote parts of Chhattisgarh were poor because of security reasons and the size of contracts
(too large for local contractors).

84.     Despite low traffic, all rural roads were being paved to flexible asphalt concrete
standards,54 calling in question the economic viability of the roads because of the high cost of
constructing paved roads. The rural roads have been overdesigned in terms of pavement
thickness and the materials used. Besides the high cost of construction, these roads are likely to
incur high maintenance costs in the long run, resulting in sustainability issues. The funding for
rural roads could have been better used if alternative low-cost technologies suited to rural roads
were explored.55

86.     ADB has a fairly large future road program. Implementing this future program and the
projects approved since 2001, which have rapidly increased, will require significant human
resources to process and monitor the projects. The relevance of these projects cannot be
doubted. But given the current performance of the ongoing projects, ADB and the Government
need to take actions to improve their implementation and find ways to ensure that future
projects are not affected. Box 5 provides an indication of the key areas where ADB could assist
in addressing the implementation problems in the transport sector.

     The designs approved by ADB use concrete pavement through villages.

            2.       Railways

87.    Appendix 1 summarizes ADB-supported railway loans, which have followed two main
themes. In 1987­1991, ADB provided two loans to support the expansion of line and freight
haulage capacity. After a decade in which no new railway loans were approved, ADB in 2002
approved a loan centered on a program of institutional and policy reforms to improve the Indian
Railway's commercial orientation,56 in parallel to its support for capital investment projects.

                     a.       Completed Projects

88.     The first rail project, which included the provision of new electric freight locomotives, was
delayed by 5 years, and the transfer of technology required a further 6 years. Implementation of
the second rail project, which included a range of physical improvements and the procurement
of wagons and spare parts, was delayed by 3 years. The project completion report rated the
project less successful because of the poor compliance with some loan covenants and the less
than full achievement of developmental impacts. Procurement for the project was overly
complex. The weaknesses in project management are attributable to the slow acceptance by
the Indian Railways of ADB's procurement policies, which differed from its procurement policies
and procedures. Railway officials, as a result, became overly cautious in evaluating tenders and
in implementing the project. Moreover, supervision by the railway management and by ADB
staff during implementation was also inadequate.

                     b.       Ongoing Project

89.    Because of the continued resistance of the Indian Railways to fundamental policy
reforms in the 1990s, ADB delayed further involvement in the rail subsector until a new policy
reform-oriented loan project was approved in 2002. The new project was aimed at improving the
performance of the rail sector by supporting a program of prescribed institutional and policy
reforms to develop the commercial orientation of the Indian Railways, expand core businesses,

finance priority investments to overcome bottlenecks in capacity, and improve operating
efficiency and safety. These reforms are expected to strengthen the Indian Railways'
accountability, transparency, and management. This reform program was agreed on between
Indian Railways and ADB and there appeared to be appropriate commitment, at the start, to
implement it. The reform program was tabled before the Parliament, an unprecedented step.
However, the program later lost momentum for two main reasons. First, a change in the
membership of the Railway Board 57 diluted awareness of the reforms and enthusiasm for
decision making. The turnover of ADB project officers also gave ADB staff few opportunities for
policy dialogue with the new Board members. Second, in the run-up to the national elections,
there was a change in the government from a coalition dominated by the Bhartiya Janata Party
to one dominated by the Congress Party. This change led to uncertainty in the commitment of
the new government to implement the reforms. However, in late 2006, consistent with the
reform agenda, the Indian Railways initiated several measures to promote the use of private
sector participation (Appendix 4).

90.    The reforms now being implemented in the railway sector selectively--commercial
development of land and air space, increasing private sector involvement in container handling,
and increasing permissible axle load--are commendable steps. However, much remains to be
done to improve decision-making as part of the organizational restructuring, further
transparency in tariff setting, and product-oriented style of operations. Thus, while progress is
being achieved in certain areas, detailed reforms have yet to make headway.

91.      While structuring and implementing such reforms in a large, complex organization was
admittedly difficult, the OEM concluded that value-added support from ADB staff was also
lacking.58 ADB project officers changed three times in 3 years, resulting in discontinuity and a
loss of institutional memory. In addition, ADB project officers dealing with the Indian Railways
did not have enough experience with railway reforms. As a result, ADB could not transfer best
practices from other countries in this area. To enable more frequent dialogue with Indian
Railways, there is a need to delegate supervision to the India Resident Mission. Such frequent
dialogues are crucial in implementing complex reforms. But the India Resident Mission would
need to be properly staffed and to have the required expertise for this responsibility. Box 6
identifies specific areas for ADB to improve the implementation of railway projects.

57
   As in most other public sector organizations in India, the composition of the Indian Railways board changes
   periodically. Although there is a strong institutional memory, the speed of decision making slows down as new
   incumbents are disinclined to take major decisions.
58
   The reform program is supported by an ADB TA, which provides management consulting services to the Indian
   Railways to monitor policy reforms and advice on business opportunities (Appendix 8).
32


92.     The implementation of the capital investment component of the project has been
delayed significantly and disbursements have been slow.59 A series of difficulties have been
experienced in the procurement for civil works associated with rail system upgrades and the
implementation of the specified policy reforms. Inadequate supervision by ADB staff adversely
affected the capital investment component. For example, four issues could have been resolved
with more effective supervision. First, the basic project design required detailed technical
specifications including detailed costing; the unfamiliarity of executing agency staff with these
led to several delays. Second, the large integrated contracts that ADB required the railway to
award drew poor responses from contractors, and the apparent raising of prequalification
criteria did not help matters. Third, there are inconsistencies between ADB's involuntary
resettlement policy and the country's national policy and laws, particularly with regard to
replacement value and indigenous people. This gap has been further widened by the inability of
ADB and the Indian Railways to arrive at a mutually acceptable procedure and output for a
resettlement plan, prompting the withdrawal of an "urgent" project from ADB assistance. Fourth,
the approval of reports by ADB was delayed in several instances. In one such instance, ADB
took 8 months to approve a social assessment report. The first two issues have since been
resolved and progress is being made on the other two. This experience underlines the point that
ADB must adopt a more flexible approach to implementing projects, rather than a standard
approach for all countries.

B.         Nonlending Projects: Technical Assistance

93.     Among multilateral and bilateral development agencies, ADB is the largest provider of
TA to the Indian transport sector. Besides helping to improve the capacity of the national
agencies and targeted state governments in key areas of road, rail, and inland waterways sector
planning and management, the TA projects were important tools for ADB in carrying out policy
dialogue on issues such as policy reforms, sector and subsector restructuring, private sector
participation, and socioeconomic considerations. In the roads and railways subsectors, from
1988 to 2005, ADB has provided 45 TA projects (19 ADTA and 26 PPTA projects) amounting to
$22.75 million ($11.53 million for the ADTA projects; $11.22 million for the PPTA projects)
(Figure 5). Appendix 8 gives details on the evaluation of the ADTA projects.




59
     The project was approved in December 2002. Only 0.5% of the loan had been disbursed by 31 December 2005
     and only 13% by 31 August 2006. By 31 December 2006, when 73% of the loan period had elapsed, only 10% of
     the project had been completed.

94.     Although ADB requires completion reports on all completed projects, only 6 such reports
(roads and highways) have been produced for the 10 completed ADTA projects. Some ADTA
projects are reviewed in project completion reports or project performance evaluation reports,
where appropriate,60 but, in general, this is a poor documentary record and internal assessment
of TA projects. Given the volume of TA involved, there is a cause for concern. This calls into
question the seriousness of ADB's effort to learn lessons from completed TA projects in the
Indian transport sector.

95.     The evaluation team examined ADTA projects for the roads and railways subsectors. The
ADTA projects can be clustered into five groups: (i) systems planning, (ii) institutional capacity
building, (iii) private sector participation, (iv) policy development, and (v) safety. Appendix 8 provides
assessments of the completed ADTA projects, based on the available TA completion reports and/or
reviews within project completion reports where available, together with the observations and
perceptions gathered during the field work. Table 8 provides a summary of these assessments.

96.     Most of the ADTA projects were relevant to the needs of the recipient agencies. Their
efficiency and effectiveness were mixed, for several reasons, such as lack of familiarity with new
systems, insufficient ownership by the recipient agency, inadequate training, and inadequate TA
design. These factors affected the sustainability and impact of the ADTA projects. Overall, four
of the 15 completed ADTA projects were highly successful, and the others showed varying
levels of success.

97.    Systems Planning. In the completed roads and highways TA projects, the new systems
were generally not fully made operational and institutionalized. The recipient executing agencies
at both national and state levels did not take ownership of the new techniques (e.g., project
monitoring systems) and, as a result, institutional impact and long-term sustainability were not
achieved. The new systems apparently did not meet the needs of the executing agencies, and
ADB's follow-up work with the agencies was ineffective in getting them to implement the
systems. The ongoing TA for the northeastern states incorporates modern techniques using
application-based tools. Technical success is likely, but whether the executing agency will
implement and use the new tools after the consultants leave remains to be seen.

98.      In the railway subsector, the TA projects focused on ways and means to improve the
efficiency and commercial orientation. While the recommendations of the first two TA projects
on ways to improve operating efficiency and rationalize nonbulk general cargo freight were
accepted, it did not accept as readily the recommendations of the third TA on ways to improve
traffic costing and financial management reporting. ADB continued its railway sector policy
dialogue to facilitate a reorientation toward a revised costing system, albeit on a pilot basis. This
dialogue did not result in effective actions, causing ADB to halt further railway lending. Better
costing is being addressed by an ongoing project, which includes a specific reform agenda.

99.     Institutional Capacity Building. The completed TA projects generally achieved positive
results, with indications of enhanced NHAI capacity for contract and environmental
management. However, the Ministry of Surface Transport and the Indian Roads Congress did
not embrace the proposed standards for highway concrete. The Government is still reviewing
the recommendations from the recently completed TA projects as part of the ongoing
restructuring. Other ongoing state level TA projects appear to have had mixed results.

100. Private Sector Participation. The completed TA projects were successful in this
regard, with NHAI adopting the guidelines for attracting the private sector in the national network
development. There was little evidence of the effectiveness of the ongoing TA 4271, however.
Considering that it was approved in December 2003, there may be some problems with
achieving its ambitious objectives. This TA, which relates to the development of high density
corridors under PPP, has been delayed and the final outcome is yet to be known. Overall, ADB
has made a positive contribution to the development of the enabling environment for the private
sector in the transport sector.

101. Railway Policy Development. The completed railway reform TA led to Loan 1981,
which contains a broad railway reform agenda. The ongoing TA supports the reform program,
although it is not clear that it will add much value in identifying specific tasks for implementing
the reforms. Both TA projects have drawn attention to the policy reforms needed to
                                                                                                               35


 commercialize operations, but the Indian Railways is slow to accept the scope of the
 recommendations and the implementation time frame.61

 102. Safety. There was one TA62 for road safety, a general one, which assisted in improving
 knowledge, capability, and training in accident analysis, traffic engineering, and design of low-
 cost measures to prevent road accidents. This TA had minimal impact. None of its
 recommendations was implemented by NHAI.

 103. Three areas for ADTA projects that ADB could usefully consider in the future are related
 to roads and highways:
        (i)     Road safety. Development of a comprehensive, multidimensional, multiagency
                program focused on the three Es of "engineering, enforcement, and education."
        (ii)    Road transport. Development of a program to improve vehicle and driver
                licensing and testing (in particular for commercial drivers and vehicles); also, a
                review of current regulations and their enforcement.
        (iii)   Road construction industry. Updating of an earlier study on the needs and
                shortcomings of the industry to improve the quantity, quality, and performance of
                local consultants and contractors.

                              V.         ASSESSMENT OF ADB ASSISTANCE

 104. This chapter assesses the general performance of ADB's assistance to the Indian
 transport sector. Table 9 gives overall ratings for the sector, taking into account the ratings for
 the various modes of transport. Completed projects are rated mainly on the basis of validated
 project completion reports and project performance evaluation reports and field visits to selected
 projects. For ongoing projects, the ratings are based on discussions with officials of ADB and
 executing agency, field visits, and a review of internal ADB documents. It must be noted that the
 ratings for ongoing projects are based on their progress. While some conclusions can be
 reached about the relevance of the project and the effectiveness of implementation, it is not
 possible to make firm conclusions on the basis of evaluative evidence related to actual traffic,
 effectiveness, economic efficiency, sustainability, or impact. Thus, the rating for ongoing
 projects are tentative and could change, as the implementation and the factors affecting actual
 traffic and socioeconomic impact improve or deteriorate. The evaluation matrix on which these
 ratings are based is in Appendix 9.

    The ongoing TA 4053, which supports the monitoring of the progress of the reform program, is managed by a team
    of consultants comprising senior former railway employees and external consultants. However, there appeared to
    be tendency among the TA consultants to rationalize the lack of progress in the reforms rather than to
    independently assess the reasons.

A.     Relevance

105. The relevance of ADB's assistance to India's transport sector was assessed mainly from
the point of view of consistency with national development strategy and responsiveness to the
country's needs (chapter III). Taking into consideration India's rapid economic growth and the
resulting need to expand the transport sector (especially roads and highways), ADB's
assistance for national, state, and rural roads is considered consistent with Government's plans
and programs. The focus of the projects is found to be relevant to the priority areas defined in
ADB's country strategies. Sector interventions were selected to help address development
needs. Over time, ADB revised its programs to match requirements in line with the changes in
the economy. The expansion of the program from centrally-based lending for national highways
to state lending for state highways and further to rural roads enabled a clearer focus on poverty.
ADB's current contribution to the national highways and rural roads program is significant
(Tables 3 and 4). The selection of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for the state highways
program is relevant to the needs of these states. The rural roads program is highly relevant to
the needs of the country as well as the pro-poor economic growth agenda of ADB. However,
most projects were found to be lacking in quality at entry. Unrealistic project designs,
inadequate readiness of executing agencies to implement the projects, and problems related to
environmental and social safeguards led to this conclusion. In the railways, ADB's early
interventions were connected to technology improvements, since the Indian Railways was
improving in that direction. The current project is relevant to the reform program, although there
is no clear strategy for the physical investment components. The railway reform program is seen
as relevant from the viewpoint of enabling the Indian Railways to function along commercial
lines and maintaining its share of the market. Overall, the transport sector program is rated as
relevant.

B.     Likely Effectiveness

106. Roads. In concept, road and highway assistance is seen as having a generally positive
effect on the development and implementation of the country's transport program. A prime
objective of the transport projects has been to increase transport capacity, which is constrained by
deficient supply, inefficient operations, poor maintenance, and weak governance and
management of the sector. These objectives have been addressed in many of ADB's projects and
progress has been made, except in the early projects, where the implementing agencies were
inexperienced and project components were spread across several states. The benefits of
highway projects (compared with lower-quality roads without the project) include reduced travel
time, vehicle operating cost savings, savings in fuel, less wear and tear on vehicles, and less
congestion. Discussions with villagers indicated that rural roads have improved connectivity and
general economic development. Such discussions as well as secondary data indicate that
improved state and rural roads directly benefit the socioeconomic development of communities
within the influence area of the route. The villagers attributed better access to medical facilities
and education opportunities and improved social status to the road improvements.

107. An analysis of the design and monitoring frameworks for road projects approved since
1995 identified a common theme of promoting private sector involvement in the national highway
projects in both road construction and maintenance. The current trends for national roads
subsector indicate that this focus on private sector participation has been effective in generating
additional sources of project funding and innovation. The major factor behind this positive finding
was the Government's general policy shift in the sector from public funding to increasing private
funding and management of projects. However, it is plausible to assert that the ADB policy
                                                                                                   37


dialogue has provided some effective contributions in this area. Overall, the effectiveness of
ADB's projects across the roads and highways portfolio is rated likely to be effective.

108. Railways. ADB's early assistance to the railway subsector generally helped increase the
capacity of the physical infrastructure and rolling stock. The completed projects provided new
locomotives that improved railway productivity and performance. The transfer-of-technology
component helped reduce the cost of manufacturing these large, more efficient locomotives in
India. The second project helped to provide the necessary capacity to handle the increasing
coal traffic from mines in Bihar and helped reduce operating costs. Both these completed
projects are rated effective.

109. In its more recent initiatives in railways, ADB has taken the lead in enabling structural
reforms in the subsector. Considering the potential impact of the reforms, these initiatives can
produce long-term benefits. However, the evidence raises concerns about when, or if, the
necessary reforms will actually be implemented. Better ADB coordination and administration in
this sector is needed to ensure that the intended benefits indeed arise. At the policy reform level,
ADB's initiatives in the railways are rated less effective.

110. Sector Objectives. The effectiveness of ADB's project and TA portfolio as a whole can be
assessed against the sector objectives. The first sector objective (physical infrastructure
development and capacity enhancement) has been mostly achieved as a result of the sections of
national highways completed with ADB support. Several issues related to the operating efficiency
of the improved roads, highways, and rail sections, however, remain. Congestion is increasing
and there are concerns about overall sustainability in terms of finance and maintenance. With
regard to the second objective (institutional strengthening and capacity building of transport
agencies), progress has also been made. Some improvements in transport sector management
are evident in NHAI and Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation, although there are
still issues regarding agency coordination, road safety, asset management, and maintenance. The
last objective (poverty reduction through infrastructure-led growth) was partly achieved on the
national, state, and railway projects, since such projects only have indirect impacts on poverty
reduction (chapter V and Appendix 12). The poor lack the financial resources to invest in the new
business opportunities resulting from better access and lower transportation costs. Their limited
skills generally do not qualify them for employment in enterprises building the new infrastructure
or in the new operating facilities. There is evidence to suggest that poverty-related benefits could
be achieved once the ADB-supported rural roads projects are fully operating, if ADB and the
executing agencies make serious efforts to address the "social inclusion" objectives of the
projects.

111. Several factors contributed to the underachievement of these sector objectives: (i) overly
optimistic traffic forecasts, (ii) delays in project implementation, (iii) little regard for transport
network planning, (iv) primary focus on capital investment projects with insufficient social
indicators for monitoring the achievements, (v) poor project design, and (vi) lack of an integrated
approach to implementation. Appendix 10 discusses these factors.

112. Overall, ADB's assistance in the transport sector is likely to be effective, but on the
lower side, subject to the resolution of the above issues.

C.     Efficiency

113. For completed projects, the evaluation of the efficiency of ADB's assistance is based on
the EIRR at completion. For ongoing projects, it is based on both EIRR estimates at appraisal and
38


implementation performance and progress as observed by the evaluation team (in mid-2006). The
completed projects are rated efficient (EIRRs greater than the 12% cutoff), although one project
had a borderline EIRR. For ongoing projects, the EIRRs estimated at appraisal are reasonably
high and well above 12%. However, there is a common concern that implementation delays, cost
overruns, and lower-than-expected traffic could adversely affect the EIRRs at completion. ADB
has initiated several measures as stated in chapter IV. However, a lot remains to be done to bring
the ongoing projects back on track. Since most of the transport projects are ongoing and all of
them face several implementation issues, the transport sector program is rated less efficient in
achieving the objectives of the sector assistance program in a timely manner. The rating for the
ongoing projects could improve if:
         (i)    measures to improve implementation are complemented with further actions to
                mitigate risk of delays;
         (ii)   projects are completed within a reasonable time;
         (iii)  there are no major cost overruns; and
         (iv)   traffic on these project sections builds up to a level that will justify the use of
                capital to rehabilitate these roads and railways.

        1.       Completed Projects

114. Roads. The completed projects are rated efficient since their EIRRs are above the
benchmark 12% rate (Table 10). However, the completion of these projects was delayed by at
least 1 year and up to 4 years. Chapter IV elaborates on the implementation performance of
these projects. In all cases, the EIRRs at completion were lower than those at appraisal. The
difference reflects (i) an increase in construction cost, (ii) implementation delays, and (iii) lower-
than-expected growth in traffic. On the policy and institutional reform side, the assistance to the
road subsector was efficient in contributing to the development of the enabling environment for
the private sector, as well as in setting up new institutions to implement projects.

115. Railways. The railway projects faced similar issues with regard to lower EIRRs at
completion compared with the forecast. The financial internal rate of return at completion for the
two projects was higher than or comparable to that calculated at appraisal. In the case of Loan
857, this reflects the tax exemption granted to the Indian Railways, which offset the increase in
project costs. For Loan 1140, the financial internal rate of return was recalculated using updated
figures. Besides this, project used least-cost solutions indicating efficient use of capital.
However, the policy and institutional reform interventions were marred by organizational inertia
toward implementing some of the ADB-supported recommendations that were part of the loans.
                                                                                                                        39


   116. Since these projects coincided with the start of ADB's involvement in India, the executing
   agencies had to familiarize themselves with ADB policies and procedures and ADB had to
   understand the sector. Good supervision and value addition by ADB staff were needed to
   address this problem. ADB's performance in this regard was weak. Appendix 9 gives an
   analysis of the individual completed projects.

              2.       Ongoing Projects

   117. Table 11 summarizes the disbursement ratios for the active loans (as of 31 December
   2006). The progress, as gauged from the amount of loan disbursed, appears to be less than
   satisfactory for most projects. The later loan projects became effective only in 2005. 63 The
   average time taken to make these loans effective, 12 months, suggests that transport projects
   consistently face start-up problems. All ongoing national highway projects continue to
   experience substantial delays caused by a range of preparatory activities and issues with
   contractors or consultants, and with safety and social concerns during and after the road
   improvement. The recurrent implementation delays that are common across projects are
   discussed in chapter IV and Appendix 6.

   118. ADB's corporate assessment of the efficiency of its operations generally revolves around
   the volume of loans approved each year. This approach neither reflects the disbursement levels
   for ongoing projects nor measures compliance with the policy for program loans. Table 11
   63
        The long interval between the date of approval and the date of loan effectiveness is a matter of concern.
40


shows that despite good performance in volume of loans approved, project implementation has
made slow progress. ADB's Medium-Term Strategy II states that, to contribute more to country
outcomes, ADB must shift from an institutional culture that gives priority to loan approval and
lending volumes to a culture where portfolio performance and contribution to country outcomes
predominate. Clearly, there is significant room for improvement in project implementation in the
transport sector in India. Owing to the complexities of project and program implementation, it
would be difficult to attribute all of the delays to any one party. Responsibility is shared by ADB
and the executing agencies. Overall, all the ongoing projects are rated likely to be less efficient.
119. The ongoing rail project (Loan 1981) is intended to increase the commercial orientation and
resolve operating bottlenecks. Besides low disbursements in the physical investment component,
however, policy and institutional reforms have progressed slowly because of the Indian Railways'
institutional reluctance to take major decisions. While the objective of improving the rail sector
performance could partly be achieved in the future with the help of capital investment projects, the
sector lacks efficiency overall, and the slow progress and uncertainty surrounding the reforms are
not helping. With increasing competition between the rail and road subsectors, both the Indian
Railways and ADB will have to pay more attention to maintaining the focus on sector improvement.
D.      Likely Sustainability
120. Sustainability has been evaluated from two angles--funding and institutional capacity. The
durability of the development gains will depend upon the resilience of the sector to mitigate the risks
identified in this section. The assessment of sustainability is complicated by the fact that ADB's
projects will be managed and maintained by a combination of private and public organizations. To
conduct a robust assessment in this scenario involves looking at the broader picture of the
Government's programs in different subsectors, using various evaluation criteria (Figure 6).

121. A financial study carried out as part of this evaluation estimated the annual funding gap,
cumulative funding gaps, and sensitivity tests with nominal budgetary support from the
                                                                                                                                                  41


Government besides the cess and toll surpluses, as well as charts for total fund utilization, capital
and maintenance expenditures, the funding gap, and cumulative market borrowing corresponding
to the cumulative funding gap. These results have been analyzed for the period 2006­2030. This
was a standalone planning exercise for NHDP; it did not take into consideration the funding needs
of other similar infrastructure development programs and the market appetite for long-term debt to
finance infrastructure projects. NHAI has been successful in inviting private sector participation.
The private sector appears willing to invest in national highway projects although there may be
limitations on the number of sponsors in India. If and when other competing sectors (e.g., energy,
health, water supply and irrigation, pipelines, ports, railways, urban transport) are opened more
widely to private sector investments, the investment flow is likely to be determined by the relative
attractiveness of the competing opportunities.64 In view of this potential limitation, there may be
some doubt as to the long-term sustainability of the NHDP in terms of the operation and
maintenance requirements. Appendix 11 provides further analysis of the sustainability indicators.

122. The financial study analyzed sustainability from the point of view of the funding gap and
the ability of NHAI to fill the gap. The analysis considered the report of the Committee on
Infrastructure's NHDP core group65 set up within the Committee of Infrastructure by the Prime
Minister66 to coordinate the financial planning for national highway development. Figure 7 shows
the funding gap and cumulative market borrowings outstanding for each year of the analysis
period. It assumes that NHAI will carry out maintenance after the BOT concessionary period.

123. Chapter IV highlights the deficiencies in the performance of NHAI in light of the
inadequacy of its technical resources. Taking into consideration the financial constraints
highlighted above and the human resource concerns, the national highway portfolio is rated
less likely to be sustainable. Low sustainability is a major concern. The related issues must
be considered by both the Government and ADB.
                2.     State Highways
124. In the states, although private sector participation for state highways and bridges has been
initiated, government (and multilateral) sources remain the primary source of funding for long-term
asset management. Few states have road funds and none are being managed on a commercial
basis. Hence, securing a stable and reliable source of funds for road maintenance is a concern. The
financial position of most state governments remains weak because of their high level of debt and
guarantees extended to various infrastructure and other projects. Even the progressive states could
find it difficult to disburse adequate funds for road rehabilitation and maintenance. In the case of
Madhya Pradesh, while its fiscal deficit position has improved and the state government has been
making efforts to provide adequate funds for rehabilitation and maintenance, the state government's
debt obligations are a persistent issue (Appendix 11). In Madhya Pradesh, there is a funding gap of
about $44 million in the first planning years. This funding gap is expected to decrease after 2012
with a reduction in expenditure on state highways since all the state roads will have been
rehabilitated by then. The funding gap could be bridged by market borrowings and from extra-
budgetary resources. If the program is pursued as assumed, there exists relatively less serious threat
to its sustainability unless the state dilutes its priority of road sector development or accelerates the
rehabilitation of district roads and village roads under its purview, at the cost of state highways.
125. Taking into consideration the improvement in the fiscal deficit position of Madhya
Pradesh, the highway projects in the state are rated likely to be sustainable. This rating
assumes that continued budget allocations are supplemented with long-term funding from
development partners. It is too early to assess the sustainability of state highway projects in
Chhattisgarh since the reforms and project implementation are still at an early stage.
                3.     Rural Roads
126. The PMGSY, sponsored by the Government, is the main vehicle for developing rural
roads all over the country. The planned expenditure is about $10.56 billion (Appendix 11), while
available funds from budget allocations, tax collections, and external assistance from World
Bank and ADB total $9.2 billion--a shortfall of more than $1 billion. The Central Road Fund Act
provides for the use of half of the diesel tax for rural roads, and development partners have
approved loans totaling $2.05 billion for rural roads. The funding gap of $1.36 billion will have to
be filled by the Government in the medium term.
127. Of particular concern with regard to rural roads is that once the rural program, which is
fully financed by the central Government is completed, responsibility for maintenance will be
turned over to the states. Besides funding concerns, local institutions may not have the human
and material resources needed to sustain a maintenance regime. These major issues need to
be addressed in ADB's policy dialogue. Given these uncertainties, ADB's rural road activities
are less likely to be sustainable.
           4.        Railways
128. The operating ratio 67 of the Indian Railways reached its highest level of 98.3% in
FY2000­2001, reflecting the relatively poor financial performance in year, with expenses only

67
     The ratio of total working expenses to total earnings expressed as a percentage.
                                                                                                               43


slightly less than earnings. Since then, performance has improved, as a result of better use of
rolling stock and changes in accounting practices. The Indian Railways is targeting an operating
ratio of 77% for FY2006­2007. Despite this apparent positive development in the financial
performance, the Rakesh Mohan Committee appointed in 2001 by the Government identified
several areas of concern. Two of the most significant were unsustainable employee costs and
the high cost of market borrowings.68 Other issues pertained to the need for increased capacity
and investments to remove bottlenecks, politically controlled (and not market-related) pricing,
the lack of a customer service culture, and weaknesses in the organization structure. Reducing
staff cost is perhaps the most difficult challenge. The Indian Railways carries 25% excess
manpower and its ordinary working expenditure increased from $2.6 billion in 1994­1995 to
$6.6 billion in 2001­2002. During the same period, pension charges grew 3.5 times and staff
wages and salaries went up 2.6 times. Pensions, staff salaries, and wages accounted for 53%
of ordinary working expenses in 2005. There has been an improvement in the traffic handled
per 1,000 employees, which rose by 27% from 548 converted ton-km in 2002 to 694 converted
ton-km in 2005. However, staff costs still constitute a major portion of working expenses,
making it difficult to adopt commercially-oriented business practices.69

129. The reforms 70 have not touched on the core needs of organizational restructuring,
transparency in tariff mechanisms, and financial accounting improvements. The financial position
improved in 2005 because of an increase in revenues (Appendix 4). However, it is not clear whether
this improvement can be sustained. Without key reforms, the Indian Railways may not be able to
retain its share of the transport market and to achieve sound financial results. Staff must be
rationalized through effective organizational reforms. However, strong resistance to downsizing
outsourcing and privatization can be expected from staff, unions, and some politicians. Ways must
be found to manage the social costs associated with such programs. The overall assessment for
Indian Railways is that given the recent improvement in its outlook, most of the economically viable
projects are likely to be completed. Taking into account the railway's improving financial
performance, the completed capital investment projects are likely to be sustainable. However, the
implementation of the reform program is less likely to be sustainable unless this program is revised
and made more realistic. Successful policy reforms and organizational restructuring are perceived to
be the key drivers of the sustainability of ADB railway assistance. Given the limited recent progress,
the railway portfolio is less likely to be sustainable overall.

E.      Likely Impacts

130. A review of the literature71 found that (i) economic growth is positively affected by the
stock of infrastructure assets, and (ii) income inequality declines as infrastructure quantity and
quality improve. As regards transport interventions, the World Bank's Poverty Reduction
Strategies Sourcebook indicates that improvements in transport have the greatest impact on
poor people when other sectoral interventions are adequately in place. Without good transport,

68
   The Indian Railways claims that it is reducing its staff and has managed to keep the cost of borrowing within
   manageable limits. It remains to be seen if this effort can be sustained and to what extent.

70
   The reforms, as discussed in Appendix 4, cover various commercial initiatives, capacity expansion, and
   improvements in freight-loading capabilities. Whether the necessary reforms are actually implemented remains to
   be seen, however.

many other sectoral interventions are likely to be ineffective. Recent studies in India have
indicated that investment in roads is ranked on top above all other public investments in terms
of providing returns in poverty reduction (Table 12). In other words, roads have the maximum
impact on poverty reduction. In light of ADB's overarching objective of poverty reduction, road
investments are seen as highly relevant for achieving ADB's development goals. Micro-level
studies have shown that improvement of roads has influenced the distributional outcomes of
socioeconomic development impacts in the rural areas.72

131. The areas were selected to reflect a sample of all social categories and groups, which
could be considered generally typical of other parts of the country. The assessment used a
process of preliminary social profiling and impact analysis of the study area affected by the
selected national, state, and rural roads. The assessment drew on consultations with local
stakeholder groups, semistructured interviews with representatives of social groups, and a
review of available secondary data to identify local perceptions of impacts. Appendix 12 gives
the results of the socioeconomic study, which are summarized below.

           1.       National Highways

132. National highways facilitate economic growth throughout the country. Despite evidence
of macro-level benefits to economic growth and development, the micro-level benefits remain
limited. The socioeconomic study in communities affected by the Surat-Manor Tollway Project
(Loan 1747) identified a range of benefits to the local population (Appendix 12). However, the
income benefits and economic growth linkages for the poorest groups were found to be far less
than anticipated at appraisal. For the lowest-income groups, because of the absence of
investment resources, the national highway did not provide the anticipated level of
socioeconomic change. At the same time, it is noted that highway projects are typically
designed to impact the national and regional economies and it would be difficult to expect such
projects to have substantial direct impact on poverty reduction. The economic benefits and
opportunities created by such roads increased growth and investment opportunities for the more
well-off groups by increasing asset value, reducing transportation times and vehicle operating
costs, and facilitating trade and business opportunities. People living in other urban areas were
also found to be investing in the rural areas along the upgraded highway, thus obtaining
economic benefits from the project. These findings suggest that the likely impact of national
road projects is modest, since the impact on poverty reduction at the local level has been
somewhat less than expected. Case studies in Appendix 12 substantiate this finding.

           2.      State Highways

133. The broad findings of the socioeconomic study for state highways in Madhya Pradesh
indicated that the effects of improved state highways on local communities were similar to the
effects of national highways, but with a few differences. Assuming that the general impacts of ADB-
funded roads would not be different from those of non-ADB-funded roads, this sample provided an
indicator of the likely impact of improved state highways in the country. Appendix 12 gives a before-
and-after comparison of key indicators--travel cost, travel time, and frequency of transport services.
The likely impact of such projects is rated as modest, in view of the limited benefits at the local level
and the resettlement issues concerning people affected by the road improvements. On one project,
structures of squatters were demolished with no compensation paid to them. Also, labor issues were
identified in a site visit to an ongoing ADB-funded road improvement project, which supplemented
the socioeconomic study. The issues ran counter to assurances made by the Government of
Madhya Pradesh at the time the loan agreement was signed, that the labor code for construction
workers would be adhered to, and any safety issues would be dealt with. In some instances, the
contractor violated Indian Roads Congress safety requirements in road construction zones73 and
those discussed in ADB's report and recommendation of the President.

           3.      Rural Roads

134. The study assessed the role of rural roads in poverty reduction. In terms of poverty impact,
rural road construction was found to contribute to reducing the income, human, and social
dimensions of poverty by giving local communities better access to socioeconomic and other
opportunities. However, the limited time and resources for the study meant that the actual
reduction in income poverty of the local communities could not be quantified. The specific impacts
of improvements in rural roads included better access to employment opportunities, increase in
deposits and loans at newly established local bank offices, a decline in infant mortality and
maternal mortality as a result of improved access to medical facilities, a decrease in the dropout
rate in primary and middle schools and an increase in travel outside the villages by girls for high
school and college education, and better prices through direct sales of agricultural crops at local
markets. Given the data from the study, rural roads projects are likely to have substantial impact.

135. The evaluation found limited effective implementation of the objectives in ADB-funded
projects dealing with social issues such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, transport safety, trafficking of
women and children, and livelihood programs for poor communities in project areas. ADB's
country strategy states that road investment projects should be socially inclusive. Relevant
measures in this regard are the following: enforcing better safety standards; providing education
on HIV/AIDS for truck drivers, a high-risk group; containing the trafficking of women and children;
and instituting livelihood projects for resettled communities. The evaluation found very little effort
to address these social issues and a lack of monitoring of progress toward the intended outcomes.

           4.      Railways

136. It is difficult to attribute specific impacts to ADB's assistance at the sector level in railways,
since the amount of ADB assistance has been small relative to the total railway investment.
Overall, however, the completed projects have had a positive impact on the railway's operating
performance by increasing capacity. The transfer of locomotive technology has helped upgrade
the quality of locomotives and improved efficiency on a wider scale. The ongoing project can have

a positive impact on the Indian Railways if it is implemented efficiently, together with the
associated reforms. The reforms can improve sector performance, if and when they are carried
out. Overall, the impact of ADB railway projects is likely to be modest but on the higher side.

                      VI.       ASSESSMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE

A.        Quality at Entry

137. An assessment of ADB-supported transport projects across all modes, completed and
ongoing, indicates that the developmental objectives were often not well defined; they were
either vague or overly ambitious. Examples of vague objectives are lowering transport costs,
improving road transport operations, removing capacity constraints, and improving transport
efficiency. Although the developmental objectives of later loans were defined more explicitly,
they were often expressed as sector objectives--reducing poverty and deprivation, providing
better access to markets, creating employment opportunities and social services, and improving
safety. Since any single project is likely to have relatively small impact on these broad
objectives, the actual achievement of these objectives by individual projects would be difficult to
measure and monitor. It is difficult to attribute the impact of these projects to the attainment of
such broad objectives. This is a common problem associated with infrastructure projects in
general and transport projects in particular. Chapter III identifies several implementation
problems, which could have been avoided with more effective project designs. Box 7
summarizes the main hindrances in the current project designs that have contributed to
implementation delays as well as lowering the development effectiveness.

                                       Box 7: Causes of Poor Project Designs

138. From the point of view of relevance of ADB's assistance, all transport projects generally
responded to the needs of the country. These needs arose from several issues across
subsectors: (i) limited transport infrastructure, (ii) congestion, (iii) increased demands for higher-
quality services, (iv) growing income disparities between rich and poor and between fast- and
slow-growing states and areas within states, and (v) concerns relating to environmental
degradation and social impacts.

139. Addressing these challenges required concerted action on three fronts. First was continued
emphasis on capacity expansion and service improvement, complemented by a focus on specific
geographic areas that met predefined criteria of poverty and infrastructure needs. While the national
perspective remained unchanged, with ADB continuing its involvement in national highways and
railways, there was a new orientation toward state and rural roads, which brought a local and
regional perspective to ADB's assistance. The change broadened ADB's support and
acknowledged its corporate objective of supporting pro-poor growth. Second, these investments
were appropriately supplemented by policy and institutional reforms to ensure the efficiency and
sustainability of infrastructure systems. While the project designs were sometimes less realistic in
the railway and state road programs, the guiding principles were sound: efficient institutions had to
                                                                                                                    47


be developed to rehabilitate and maintain the infrastructure assets. The success of ADB's support
for the development of NHAI underlines its relevance and effectiveness. Third, infrastructure
development often results in environmental degradation, involuntary resettlement, and other
negative impacts on vulnerable groups. ADB's safeguard policy attempted to address these issues.
Overall, ADB's support covered the themes as is summarized in Table 13.

140. Despite the above-mentioned issues relating to project design, ADB has maintained its
comparative advantage in the physical infrastructure, which has been consistent throughout the
various country strategies. In its early involvement in the country, ADB decided that it lacked the
necessary familiarity with the country to engage in policy reforms. Later, as its assistance grew,
48


institutional and policy reforms were included in road and railway operations. While continued
involvement in physical infrastructure is deemed relevant, the expansion of ADB's operations to
include policy dialogue is highly relevant. In a country as large as India, ADB's strategic impact
will come from policy reform and knowledge-based products rather than just financing of specific
pieces of transport infrastructure.

B.     Contribution to Development Results

141. ADB's interventions in the transport sector have contributed indirectly to achieving
development results, including poverty reduction. The broader involvement in infrastructure
provision has produced economic development on several fronts (chapter V and Appendix 12).
Besides physical interventions, ADB has enhanced its responsiveness to client's needs and
client ownership through a flexible but consistent strategic approach to sector assistance
programs, and increased policy dialogue and advisory assistance through TA over the study
period. ADB's planned value added through its nonlending assistance has covered four major
areas: (i) policy development (e.g., Indian Railways and private sector participation in
expressways); (ii) capacity building and institutional strengthening (e.g., NHAI, Indian Railways);
(iii) enhanced awareness of and compliance with social safeguards (environment, resettlement,
climate change, HIV/AIDS); and (iv) road safety (e.g., fewer road accidents, weigh stations to
deter overloading of vehicles).

142. ADB's operational strategy in response to the results of the midterm appraisal of the
10th FYP and the mainstreaming of poverty reduction was to orient its interventions toward
combating poverty through infrastructure-led growth--on the assumption that better
infrastructure would create more employment opportunities and broaden the economic base.
ADB's program for 2006­2008 reflects this strategy. Infrastructure projects (transport, urban
sector, and energy) account for 77% of the 3-year pipeline, and transport alone accounts for
almost half of the overall pipeline. ADB's plans for the transport sector in India seek to apply
lessons learned from recent portfolio implementation reviews by applying "significant and
sustained effort to build capacity" in new transport projects within the states Uttaranchal and in
northeastern India, which have relatively higher levels of poverty.

143. While the above strategies have the potential to contribute positively to the development
results, poor implementation performance combined with unsustainable ADB assistance could
dilute this contribution. Overall, the contribution to development results is rated modest.

C.     Assessment of ADB Performance

144. ADB has helped shape parts of the transport sector in India, although this is an initiative
that is clearly led by the Government. Over the past 20 years, ADB has provided consistent
support for the transport sector (excluding urban and air transport and, until recently, inland
waterways transport), in the process helping reduce capacity constraints on the national highways
and rail systems, and at some major ports, promoting growth in private sector participation and,
indirectly, facilitating economic growth. ADB has generally responded to the needs of the sector
by adjusting its strategies and policies to keep in step with changing needs and the Government's
FYP. However, ADB operations have largely reacted to situations, rather than helping the
Government to develop forward-looking strategies based on sound analysis. Together they could
identify a multimodal, integrated approach to attain an efficient balance between the capacity of
transport modes and user demand. The formulation of specific ADB transport sector projects has
been beset by overly optimistic demand forecasts, overly ambitious objectives, and consistently
unrealistic implementation schedules and institutional capacity. There have been several
                                                                                                 49


contributory factors: (i) inadequate ADB appraisal and due diligence, partly because of the limited
resources devoted to project preparation stage; (ii) limited experience of ADB staff in specialized
areas such as transport sector analysis, policy reform, transport management, institutional
capacity building, road safety, and socioeconomic aspects; (iii) demand forecasts based on overly
optimistic forecasts of economic growth, population, and vehicle ownership growth; and
(iv) inability of ADB to learn from past experience to improve the design of future projects.

145. One issue has been the relatively small number of ADB staff involved with the India
transport sector program in the new millennium, given the size of the sector, its scope across all
modes, and complexity (involving policy reforms, institutional capacity building, complex
government procedures, procurement, social and environmental issues, and a range of
specialist subcomponents). ADB's South Asia Infrastructure Division processed almost half of
ADB loans (in number and amount) in 2001­2004.

146. In 2001­2002, ADB committed to increasing its lending to India to support the country's
rapid economic growth. The transport sector was seen as one of the sectors in which ADB
lending would increase significantly. As a result, the volume of transport loans approved
increased sharply, and by 2003 transport loans to India accounted for half of all transport loans
to the Asian region. However, the number of staff involved in the Indian transport sector
remained unchanged. Staff resources were overloaded as the level of projects that had to be
processed and administered exceeded the institutional capacity.

147. In such circumstances, it is unlikely that ADB's professional staff have been allocating
enough time to either loan processing or project administration. According to a 2004 study of
ADB's resource requirements, ADB's Budget, Personnel, and Management Systems Department
estimated that 75 staff-weeks are needed to process an infrastructure loan. However, loans to the
transport sector in India have been processed in much less time. This may be a measure of high
efficiency, but it could also indicate that not enough attention is given to structuring appropriate
project designs, making sufficient preparations with the executing agencies, and generally making
robust appraisals. The latter interpretation would be consistent with the continuing long start-up
delays for Indian transport projects. Evaluation findings indicate weaknesses in quality at entry
(e.g., excess period required for loans to take effect, weaknesses in project design, poor selection
of subprojects for sector loans). These findings suggest that ADB has focused more on the
volume of loan approvals than the achievement of development results.

148. Loan administration responsibilities are split between ADB headquarters and the India
Resident Mission transport specialists. This arrangement has been evolving. The Government
has requested that more transport sector projects should gradually be assigned to the Resident
Mission. In theory, ADB could thus respond better to executing agency requests for information,
meetings, and decisions on projects. ADB and World Bank transport sector portfolios in India
are about the same size. However, the World Bank has eight transport specialists in its Delhi
office and three in Washington. ADB has one full-time transport specialist in the Resident
Mission, and two national staff members to support him. In Manila, ADB has five transport
specialists, who have loan processing and administration responsibilities in several other South
Asian countries besides India. This comparison indicates that ADB lacks adequate frontline
transport staff in the India Resident Mission. The effects of this staffing situation are that, with
three transport specialists having responsibility for administering 15 projects with the Resident
Mission, the concerned staff had to undertake fewer and shorter field missions. In addition, they
have to participate in four transport portfolio review meetings each year, when meetings are
held over 3 days with executing agencies and the Department of Economic Affairs to review
progress on the transport projects.
50



149. Besides the number of staff, the expertise of ADB staff has been found to be less than
adequate for managing complex implementation issues. Consultations between ADB and the
Government74 have indicated that the high turnover of ADB staff and the fielding of mission leaders
without adequate experience and technical knowledge have resulted in low-quality project designs
and implementation delays. Issues related to the number of staff and skill mix extend far beyond a
division, regional department, and vice president. This is a corporate issue. The finding of this
evaluation is that rigidities in the system have prevented ADB from matching its human resources to
the need to adequately process and administer a growing portfolio and to provide an important client
with the level of service that it should expect. Taking into account the weaknesses in project design
and the severity of implementation delays that appear to be associated with an inadequate level of
human resources and skill mix, ADB's performance is rated only partly satisfactory.

150. ADB will need to decide whether it is practical to continue to increase the size of its
operations in the Indian transport sector, in light of the human resource constraints. If ADB cannot
strengthen its resources, then it must limit its future assistance in this sector to a level that is
consistent with its human resource capacity. Such decisions must include adequate project
administration as well as sound project processing. If the current pipeline is to be maintained or
increased, ADB will need to ensure an overall expertise that covers the areas listed in Box 8.
Besides, ADB will need to build a team of experts with experience in these areas gained outside
ADB as well as sufficient project processing and project administration experience within ADB.

A.         Assessment of ADB Assistance (Bottom-Up)

151. The rating for the completed assistance is based on the validation of available evaluation
evidence and field visits to sample projects. The rating for ongoing assistance is based on
discussions with officials of ADB and the Government, field visits, and a review of ADB progress
reports. The ratings for the ongoing portfolio could change with variations in the implementation
efficiency of both ADB and the government agencies, and are intended to draw attention to
current challenges rather than to pass a judgment on performance after project completion (see
chapter V for details).

covered in the evaluation. Appendix 9 provides details of the project ratings.76

             1.         Relevance

   153. All the projects were relevant in maintaining focus on the priority areas defined in the
   country strategies (chapter III). This rating is based on several factors. First, the sector strategy
   was consistent with ADB's overall goal of promoting pro-poor growth and with the country's
   evolving priorities. In the first years of ADB involvement, the expansion of physical infrastructure
   was seen as the priority by both ADB and the Government. The initial strategy and projects
   were consistent with this thinking. But as the growing importance of policy changes was
   recognized, the focus was broadened to include institutional and policy reforms. Second, the
   assistance to the sector was adjusted to take into account the growing private sector
   participation. This was a positive change. Third, ADB's assistance has traditionally focused on
   physical infrastructure, which is seen as its comparative advantage. This orientation continues,
   albeit on a more comprehensive scale that includes policy dialogue. Finally, harmonization with
   other development partners has been limited to macro-level geographic distribution of activities.
   While this approach is relevant to the needs of the country, there is room for further improving
   this harmonization to cover policy dialogue and program implementation.

             2.         Likely Effectiveness

   154. The rating for the likely effectiveness of road and highway projects is based on an
   analysis of the benefits associated with similar roads as well as the situation without such
   projects in Chhattisgarh, which has yet to experience a substantial infusion of funds. Since most
   of the projects are ongoing, this rating is tentative and could change when the actual
   achievements are known. The completed projects have effectively achieved their objectives.
   However, because of the observed implementation deficiencies discussed in chapter IV, these
   projects cannot be considered highly effective. Road improvements, in general, result in
   reduced travel times, vehicle operating cost savings, fuel savings, and reduced congestion.
   Rural roads are expected to provide better access and several socioeconomic benefits.
52



155. While ADB railway assistance has effectively contributed to improving freight handling
capacity, the actual size of ADB's funding is small compared with the overall requirements. The
crucial test of effectiveness lies in the implementation of the current reform program, which has
been delayed. The record of the Indian Railways in implementing reforms has been poor,
although there has been some progress in the recent years. This slow implementation of reforms
reflects two factors: (i) unrealistically designed reform packages, and (ii) a lack of organizational
capacity and direction to implement the reforms. While the assistance for physical investments is
expected to improve rail services, slow progress on the reform program could reduce the overall
benefits of ADB assistance. Overall, in the transport sector, taking into consideration the projects
completed and assuming that the ongoing projects are completed efficiently, the assistance is
likely to be effective, but on the lower side.

             3.       Efficiency

156. For the few completed projects, the EIRRs at completion were lower than those
estimated at appraisal, although the EIRRs in all cases were higher than the 12% benchmark
for satisfactory performance. Increased construction costs, delays in implementation, changes
in maintenance costs, and lower traffic forecasts contributed to the lower-than-expected but still
acceptable EIRRs. The fact that the EIRRs were higher than 12% would imply a reasonable
efficiency of the capital invested in the projects. The delays in implementation ranged from
1 year to 4 years, with an average delay of 2.4 years. ADB-supported transport projects in India
experienced longer project implementation delays on average than those in the People's
Republic of China and Sri Lanka.77

157. Most of the road and highway projects are ongoing. All the active projects suffer from
low disbursements caused by start-up delays, procurement issues, and construction problems
(chapter IV). Poor project design and difficulties in addressing safeguard issues have further
delayed implementation. This is true of the railway project as well. In view of the general
implementation problems experienced, the Indian transport sector portfolio is rated likely to be
"less efficient." This rating may improve provided steps are successfully taken to improve project
implementation and to implement necessary sector reforms.

             4.       Likely Sustainability

158. Considerable progress has been made in NHDP and the State Highway Program, but is
less evident in the rural road program. The main challenge is to ensure that the current pace of
the various programs improves with assurance of adequate funding for the pipeline of projects
planned at the central and state levels (section D, chapter V). In parallel, there is a need for a
systematic approach to maintaining the networks, including securing the required levels of
maintenance financing, and building the necessary capacity and systems. For roads whose
maintenance has been assigned to government agencies, there may be difficulties in ensuring
the availability of reliable funding, human resources, and materials for road maintenance.
Contractor capacity and capability presents another challenge to sustainability. On the
Government's side, there are concerns regarding the sustainability of ADB's institutional
capacity-building efforts, particularly when employees are on deputation from other government
agencies. These concerns about sustainability reflect evaluation findings at the policy,
organizational, and project levels. Railway assistance sustainability revolves around policy and
organizational reforms, which appear to be less likely to be sustainable. But this sustainability

77
     The average delay in loan closing in the People's Republic of China is 1.23 years and in Sri Lanka, 1.81 years.
                                                                                                    53


rating is based on the current situation and it could change with shifts in policy and
improvements in administrative and contractual capabilities. For example, a change in the toll
policy or the tax regime could generate more funds for the national and rural roads programs.
Overall, the transport sector assistance is less likely to be sustainable.

         5.      Likely Impacts

159. Despite evidence that transport projects contribute to general economic growth and
indirectly to poverty reduction, the potential impact of the completed outputs appears to be
modest, given the concerns about the efficiency and sustainability of the assistance. National
and state highways are likely to make satisfactory contributions to the national and regional
economies. With the national economy growing rapidly, the economic contribution of highways
is positive. All the completed projects, ADB as well as non-ADB funded, have experienced
growth in traffic. Road improvements may have had a negative impact on small businesses
along the road alignment because road improvements resulted in better traffic flow and a loss of
business, yet highways have contributed to the enabling environment for economic growth and
livelihood opportunities (section E, chapter V and Appendix 12). In the case of rural roads, the
impact on employment opportunities, access to credit, access to health and education facilities,
farm-gate prices, and access to urban areas has been generally positive. Not all of these
impacts can be solely attributed to road improvements, however. The presence of an all-
weather road is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the improvement of local
socioeconomic conditions. Overall, the impact of rural roads and highways assistance is likely to
be modest to substantial. In the case of railways, it is difficult to attribute specific impacts to ADB
assistance or to any single project. But improvements in the railway capacity have had a
positive impact on its ability to carry more traffic and thus contribute more to the national
economy. There is no evidence yet that ADB's railway policy reform agenda has had a
substantial impact on Indian Railways. Although ADB's assistance has contributed positively to
improving the development conditions, it needs to be acknowledged that its impact is modest in
comparison to the overall needs of the country and the interventions from the Government itself.
Overall, potential contribution of the ADB assistance is seen as modest but on the higher side.

         6.      Overall Bottom-Up Assessment of ADB Assistance

160. Overall, given its ratings on the five criteria discussed above, ADB's transport sector
program in India is considered only partly successful. The program has appropriately adjusted its
operations to reflect the changing the needs of the country. All completed projects have achieved
their expected outputs with satisfactory quality, though with delays in implementation, time
overruns, and reductions in scope. All ongoing projects have encountered implementation
problems. It remains to be seen if the ongoing efforts to address implementation problems will
succeed. Upon completion, the projects are expected to provide the intended benefits. Policy
changes related to financing, particularly for maintenance, could deal with sustainability concerns.

B.     Assessment of Strategic Performance (Top-Down)

161. This section assesses ADB's strategic performance along three dimensions: (i) sector
positioning and quality of entry of country strategies, (ii) contribution to development results, and
(iii) ADB's performance. Although there would appear to be a certain degree of overlap between
these indicators and those used in the bottom-up assessment, different indicators were used to
evaluate performance in the top-down approach. Table 15 gives the ratings for the top-down
indicators.

162. Sector Positioning and Quality of Sector Entry. ADB's strategic selection of
subsectors and priority areas over the three phases of its involvement in the Indian transport
sector is significant and appropriate to the needs of the country (chapter III). The broadening of
the strategy from a physical infrastructure focus to support for policy reform, particularly the
development of private sector participation and capacity building, supports this rating. The
concentration on roads and highways was consistent with and relevant to the Government's
national development plans, but the planned diversification into inland waterways was not based
on sufficient analysis. The entry into the port sector and the subsequent exit was logical. The
positioning of ADB in the railway subsector is appropriate, but the implementation, both of policy
reform and of physical infrastructure, has been fraught with problems, caused partly by poor
project design. The quality of entry across all parts of the transport sector was ambitious and
challenging (chapter VI). As with all infrastructure sectors, attributing broad socioeconomic
development impacts to specific transport sector interventions is difficult. More realistic and
perhaps more modest program designs that have clear links with the outputs and the likelihood
of achieving the outcomes are required. ADB's overall strategic positioning in the transport
sector in India is rated as substantial.

163. Contribution to Development Results. There is an indirect link between the
development of transport infrastructure and poverty reduction. ADB's strategy in the transport
sector in India has focused on improving the quality and capacity of the road and railway
infrastructure. This strategy was sound, as the enabling environment for economic development
had to be created in the local and regional contexts. Several studies, including the
socioeconomic study conducted as part of this evaluation, show that better transport
infrastructure is positively correlated with pro-poor growth and development (footnote 71).
ADB's value added in the road subsector has been significant in policy development,
institutional strengthening, encouraging private sector participation, promotion of public
awareness of social and environmental safeguards, and attention to related issues. But ADB's
value addition in the railways subsector is not clear. The poor implementation performance of
ADB assistance, outlined in chapter IV has reduced the potential contribution to development
results. In the case of rural roads, the correlation between road improvement and economic
development is strong at the local level. Improved national and state highways also support
economic development, although the impact is indirect and felt more at the regional and national
levels (section E, chapter V and Appendix 12). On the other hand, highways are seen as
detrimental to the lowest-income groups. The lack of adequate provision for social inclusion in
the project designs affected the contribution to development results. Overall, although ADB's
transport sector strategy has had substantial indirect but positive contribution to development
results, its downside reduces the overall rating to modest, albeit on the higher side.

164. ADB's Performance. The Government and other development partners appreciate
ADB's assistance to India's transport sector. However, the implementation issues facing the
projects have diluted ADB's position as the prime transport sector development partner. Similar
                                                                                                                     55


problems related to implementation confront the World Bank. ADB's efforts to increase lending
volumes in the early part of this decade were successful. However, there was no
complementary deployment of staff resources (section C, chapter VI). Government agencies
have pointed out deficiencies in the quantity and quality of ADB staff working in the transport
sector. Although this issue could in theory be addressed by ADB, the wider implementation
issues causing delays require a more comprehensive dialogue with the Government. Issues
relating to compliance with environmental and social safeguards as well as the harmonization of
procurement procedures have wider ramifications. Overall, taking into account the extent of
implementation delays and the constraints on staff resources, ADB's performance has been
modest.

C.         Overall Rating of All Levels of Performance

165. The overall performance of ADB's transport sector program, combining the bottom-up
and top-down assessments, has been only partly successful, but on the higher side (Table
16).78

                                    VIII.    ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A.         Main Issues Identified

              1.       Implementation of Policy Reforms

166. Policy reforms and plans to restructure the various Indian transport agencies are being
developed to better rationalize the planning, policy making, regulatory, and operating aspects of
transport systems. Once these reforms and plans are fully implemented, the public sector is
expected to be more responsive and accountable for administrative facilitation (planning,
policies, and regulation). Private sector involvement in project executions and the provision of
transport services should increase. A pragmatic reform agenda must be identified for each state
that reflects the local context and ensures that the reforms and the anticipated time frame are
realistic, given the institutional and political economy constraints.

167. ADB and the Indian Railways had developed an agenda for policy reforms that involves
adopting commercially-oriented operating systems (chapter IV). Progress on implementing
these reforms has been slow and, despite earlier efforts in the 1980s and 1990s, the Indian
Railways has achieved less than its full potential. With the growing freight demand and increase
in modal competition for passenger traffic, Indian Railways faces several challenges in terms of
restructuring and further improving its financial and operating performance. To do so would
require a more commercial orientation and the ability to deal with difficult problems like
accounting systems, overstaffing, and organizational restructuring.

78
     Sector performance (overall) is rated as follows: highly successful if the score is 40 or higher; successful, 30­39;
     partly successful, 20­29; and unsuccessful, 19 or less.
56



           2.       Coordination of Institutions

168. Despite the fact that ADB has been working with various government institutions, there
is little evidence to suggest sufficient coordination among concerned institutions (chapter IV).
There is little interaction between the NHAI and the Ministry of Rural Roads, although both
national highways and rural roads are centrally funded. There has been insufficient coordination
between the NHAI and the various State Governments, causing delays in land acquisition.
There is little consideration at the technical level of coordination or collaboration with other
modal agencies, e.g., interaction between roads agencies and Indian Railways is very limited.
Thus, the possibility of the Indian Railways offering "door to door" service--incorporating rail or
waterway transshipment services, or piggyback container services with containers on road
trailers transported by rail to ports--has not been considered, except perhaps by the Planning
Commission, while preparing the FYPs. Similarly, the interface between agencies dealing with
national and state highways and those dealing with major urban roads and urban transport
service needs are not taken into account in planning by NHAI, the states, and urban authorities.
The long-term strategic goal should be to develop and capitalize on synergies through a more
integrated multimodal system to lower logistical costs for transport users. ADB needs to
undertake a more intense policy dialogue to encourage better coordination among these
institutions.

           3.       Limitations of the Construction Industry

169. The infrastructure construction industry (contractors and consultants) is having difficulty
in coping with the large amount of civil works contracts for the massive infrastructure
rehabilitation efforts in India, including its transport sector. Given the demands associated with
the road construction programs which are set to continue until 2012 and beyond, and the PPP
schemes which will run for 20­25 years, the industry needs to be strengthened for the program
targets to be achieved. The strengthening process must recognize that India's university
students and graduates have competing career opportunities, many of which offer higher
salaries and other benefits. The industry and the Government may have to consider offering
incentives to make the construction industry more attractive to new graduates.79

           4.       Safety of Transport Systems and Services

170. A recent paper80 reported that road traffic fatality rates (fatalities per 10,000 vehicles) in
India have decreased steadily, from 18.3% in 1999 to 12.8% in 2003.81 However, 12.8% is still
about 10 times the average fatality rate in member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, all of which have developed and implemented multidimensional road safety
programs. In India, 86,000 persons, or about 10 people every hour, were killed in road traffic
accidents in 2003, according to official records. A Planning Commission in 2000 estimated the
social cost of traffic accidents at 3% of GDP. Appendix 8 elaborates on the gravity of this issue.

171. India does not have a systematic and uniform process of collecting, analyzing, and
interpreting traffic accident data. Road safety audits conducted as part of road improvement

79
   An ongoing World Bank study is examining the supply side constraints in the Indian construction industry.

   Conference, Bangkok, May.
81
   The World Bank (according to the same source) quotes a fatality rate of 20.3% for 2003 and other recent
   documents suggest that official traffic accident figures could be underreporting the number of traffic fatalities by
   almost 60%.
                                                                                                            57


schemes (including ADB-funded programs) range from the superficial (as in the detailed project
reports) to the comprehensive (as in the Western Transport and East-West Corridor projects).82
However, at present, audits are done only once during the development of a road improvement
scheme (and not at all before construction). Their recommendations may or may not be acted on.
The experience in other countries indicates that the use of seatbelts and infant seats, driver
training and education, vehicle safety inspection, blackspot analysis, and better enforcement
contribute to improved traffic safety. The seriousness of the road safety situation in India has been
recognized and consideration is being given to establishing a more focused, coordinated road
safety program led by a centralized, dedicated organization with a reliable source of funding. If this
plan is effectively implemented, it would be a positive step toward improving traffic safety.

          5.       Climate Change

172. Economic growth, urbanization, economic liberalization, rising incomes, and higher
aspirations of people living in India have all led to increased mobility and greater motor vehicle
ownership.83 As a result, transportation sector greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are increasing.
Addressing this issue will require action on many fronts. Policy interventions can be used to
reduce transport GHG emissions. Examples would include adopting fuels with lower GHG
emissions; reducing fuel consumption per passenger- or freight-km traveled; increasing the
distance traveled per unit of fuel for individual vehicles; using taxes, incentives, and fiscal
instruments to encourage environmentally friendly behavior; ensuring that the cost of pollution is
borne by the polluter; and better spatial planning, particularly in urban areas. On the project
implementation side, ADB has been working with the Government in developing environmental
safeguards systems that are better aligned with the country's priorities and procedures (section
B, chapter III). These need to include mechanisms for climate change impact mitigation.

173. A recent ADB workshop, "Climate Change Mitigation in the Transport Sector," 84
developed projections of energy demand in the transport sector in several developing member
countries. The forecast energy use reflected the growth in the number of vehicles, increased
use of vehicles, the fuel efficiency of vehicles, and fuel energy intensity. The workshop
estimated that energy use by the transport sector in India would grow by 5­8% yearly. Over the
next 20 years, the demand for energy would more than treble. While the rhetoric on this issue
has been growing, the development partners, including ADB, must work with the Government to
address GHG emissions in future operations in the Indian transport sector.

B.      Recommendations for Future Assistance

174. The evaluation of ADB's assistance program to the Indian transport sector has identified
several broad problem areas. For ADB, these are related to weaknesses in project design,
project administration/supervision, and staffing, as well as pervasive implementation delays. For
the Government, the problem areas include lack of coordination among transport agencies,
delays in project implementation, and inadequate provision for social inclusion in project
designs. The following recommendations (Table 17) address these areas and provide directions
for prioritizing ADB's sector positioning. 85 These recommendations are put forward as
directional inputs to the preparation of a new country partnership strategy.86

175.    ADB needs to continue its interventions in the roads and highways subsectors, refining
them by providing a focus on the relatively less developed states especially in the north-eastern
part of India. This will need to be accompanied by measures taken to learn from past
experience to address problems typically experienced across the country. Because of the
positive development impacts associated with state highways and rural roads, ADB should
continue to support projects, policies, and institutions in these areas. ADB's current inclination to
provide assistance in viability gap funding for the NHDP needs to be continued. Such projects
that have satisfactory economic returns are suitable for ADB supported public sector financing.

                                 PORTS AND INLAND WATERWAYS

A.        Background

1.     This appendix gives a brief overview of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB's)
assistance to the port and inland waterway subsectors. ADB has gradually reduced its
assistance to the port subsector in the last decade. The inland waterways transport (IWT)
subsector, on the other hand, was seen as a potential area for new funding assistance. This
appendix also summarizes the assessment of performance in these two subsectors and
suggests directions for improving the effectiveness of ADB's assistance.

2.       There are 12 major ports and 187 minor and intermediate ports along the
7,517 kilometer (km) coastline of the country. The Department of Shipping in the central
government oversees the shipping and port subsector, which comprises shipbuilding and ship
repair, major ports, national waterways, and IWT. Studies made by the evaluation team found
the port sector to be on a fast (10% plus) growth track, fueled by robust growth in gross
domestic product and export/import trade. While private investments can flow into port
operations (berths, cranes, yards, storage, etc.), there is a need to invest in common user
facilities like capital dredging (for draft enhancement); hinterland connectivity (rail and road);
port vicinity development (roads); and capacity development in licensing arrangements,
appropriate oversight, marketing, and even business development with a global focus.

3.      The Inland Waterways Authority of India was created in October 1986 to develop and
regulate inland waterways for shipping and navigation. The authority primarily undertakes
projects for the development and maintenance of IWT infrastructure on national waterways, with
the help of grants from the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways. Transport
movements between India and Bangladesh give the IWT subsector a potential subregional
dimension. But with the poor progress of ADB technical assistance (TA), this potential still has to
be tapped. Commercially viable IWT on the two national waterways, North-West 1 and North-
West 2,1 linking the northeastern states of India with Bangladesh needs to be revitalized. At the
same time, measures are needed to reactivate the subsector, particularly to improve river
navigability, develop the vessel fleet and terminals, establish institutional arrangements (for public-
private partnership [PPP]), and extend the protocol agreement between India and Bangladesh.

4.      Table A2.1 lists ADB-supported loans for Indian ports. ADB approved five loans from
1987 to 1997. All the projects were aimed at physical improvements in India's major maritime
ports to enable them to handle specific commodities (i.e., fertilizer, coal, liquid cargo) and
containers, and to improve operating efficiency and enhance capacity.2 Figure A2.1 shows the
locations of ADB projects.

5.        Although all ADB ports projects experienced delays in implementation, the project
completion reports and project performance evaluation reports rated them "partly" or "generally
successful" in improving and modernizing port facilities. The economic internal rates of return
(EIRRs) were in most cases less at completion than at appraisal, as a result of the delays and
other issues during implementation. The supporting advisory technical assistance (ADTA) projects
for the projects were all considered mostly relevant, consistent with individual project objectives,
and also effective in developing systems and procedures to facilitate improved operations. As a
result of one TA3 completed in 2002, the Government of India embarked on its present continuing
initiative directed at port privatization and corporatization. That TA had a major, strategic impact.

6.      With the completion of the Mumbai and Chennai ports (Loans 1556 and 1557) in 2003,
ADB effectively withdrew from the port subsector as the enabling environment for private sector
involvement in Indian ports became effective. However, the project performance audit report
(2001) for the Second Ports Project noted that port construction costs in India are high by
international standards while tariffs are low, thereby causing problems of financial sustainability of
new ports. The project performance audit report identified the high costs of dredging, breakwaters,
and other basic infrastructure as the main deterrents, and noted that most of the world's top ports
use public rather than private funds for dredging. The project performance audit report concluded
in 2001 that "ADB's continued investments in ports infrastructure, in addition to continued
involvement in sector reforms, are warranted, and would help attract private investment."

7.     Discussions with officials of the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways,
Planning Commission, and a port authority indicated that current issues in the port subsector
include connectivity constraints. Although private sector participation has enhanced port traffic
handling capacity, railway and road connectivities from the port to the nearest mainline junction
are poor. With the Indian Railways and roads agencies mostly developing country networks,
these port connectivities are proving to be a major bottleneck.

8.      The Planning Commission's approach paper for the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP)
recognized the improvements made during the 10th FYP but observed that major expansion and
modernization will be required to support the growth in the gross domestic product and trade
envisaged for India. As a result, during the 11th FYP period, ports and related infrastructure will
be developed to international standards in turnaround time and clearing of import and export
cargoes. The paper noted that current trends suggest that by 2015­2016, cargo traffic through
Indian ports will amount to about 2,000 million tons, compared with 569 million tons handled in
2005­2006--a 250% increase--and that substantial increases in capacity at both major and
minor ports will, therefore, be required. The approach paper indicated that the requisite capacity
increases would need to be undertaken through PPP and by captive users, although an evident
requirement to expand common user facilities would be financed by the Government and other
port stakeholders, including port trusts and major users.

         2.      Inland Waterways

9.      ADB exited from this subsector in 2006. The only intervention had been in the form of a
project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)4 that had been initiated as the mode of entry.
Besides an ability to promote pro-poor growth, the IWT subsector has the potential to be both
socially and environmentally friendly, particularly benefiting the northeast states, while also
enhancing opportunities for regional integration with Bangladesh. ADB's attempted entry into
this new subsector was rather tentative and lacked a realistic approach. The TA scope was
unrealistic in the sense that it combined a sector study with a PPTA, resulting in a halfhearted
attempt to understand the IWT subsector. Since this was a new subsector for ADB, the
approach could have been better determined with the development of a definitive sector
development strategy before a PPTA was initiated. This lack of long-term perspective was
compounded by the inexperience of ADB staff in the IWT subsector. ADB and the Government
differed on the source of funding for this project, with the Government requesting an Asian
Development Fund loan and ADB offering a loan from ordinary capital resources. All of these
issues prompted an exit from the subsector.

10.      The evaluation team's discussions with officials of the Inland Waterways Authority of
India; Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways; and Planning Commission indicated
deficiencies in the basic infrastructure and navigation of the IWT subsector and limited
opportunities for private sector involvement (other than as service providers). This suggests a
need for public funding to catalyze the subsector as an alternative or possible feeder service to
roads and rail, and to facilitate port connectivity. Although investment, policy change, and
institutional development are needed, there has been little progress in addressing the strategic
issues. Given the extent of the above issues, there appears to be no logic for ADB to continue
being involved in this subsector. Unless ADB resolves its staffing issues and develops an
agreement with the Government on the nature of funding, continued presence in this subsector
is not likely to yield any development impacts.

11.      Although inland waterways are, conceptually, a relatively eco-friendly, cost-effective, and
fuel-efficient mode of transport, the IWT carries only 0.15% of total inland cargo. IWT has
competed successfully to become a major transport mode in India. There are three national
waterways (e.g., Ganga, Brahmaputra, and West Coast Canal) with a total length of 2,700 km.
The Government has initiated several measures to integrate waterways, e.g., the Kakinada-
Pondicherry canal system to be connected to the Godavari and Krishna rivers (1,095 km) in
Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu; the East Coast Canal from Paradip to Haldia (623 km) to be
connected to the Brahmani river and the Mahanadi river delta in Orissa and West of Bengal;
and the Barak river from Karimganj to Lakhipur (140 km) in Assam. The Government intends to
rehabilitate and build terminals to handle containers. There remains a potential for further IWT
development, since this could reduce the traffic congestion from the road and rail subsectors
and improve regional trade links with Bangladesh.

C.       Implementation Efficiency

12.   ADB's assistance to the port subsector is summarized in Table A2.2. In the IWT
subsector, ADB's assistance progressed no further than the Inland Waterway Sector
Development Strategy (PPTA 3974), which was approved in 2002.

13.    Loan 842. The project was delayed by 4 years because of procurement delays and slow
government approvals. Start-up delays reflected a lack of familiarity with ADB's procedures and
poor project management. A project performance audit report 5 reestimated the EIRRs at
completion and found them to be lower than the appraisal estimates (Table A2.3). The same
was true for the financial internal rates of return.

14.     For two of the three subprojects, the EIRRs were lower than 12% because of overly
optimistic estimates of traffic growth and lower efficiency gains in cargo handling. Although
reductions in transport costs could be anticipated, the delayed implementation reduced the
efficiency of the project.

15.     Loan 1016. Implementation was delayed by 2 years and 9 months because of project
start-up problems. The EIRRs for the subprojects at completion were significantly below those
estimated at appraisal for the same reasons as for Loan 842. The financial internal rates of
return were also lower at completion than at appraisal because of lower-than-expected
revenues from project facilities (Table A2.4).

16.     Loan 1181. This project was delayed by 3 years and 10 months because of a
combination of slow government approvals and construction delays. Delays in setting up the
project implementation unit continued. The EIRR for the project at completion (17.5%) was
below that estimated at appraisal (22.3%) because of the recurrent issue of ambitious traffic
estimates and delays in realization of peak cargo traffic. No postevaluation was conducted for
this project.

D.       Likely Effectiveness

17.     ADB's assistance to the port subsector ceased in the late 1990s, by which time the
private sector was actively engaged in several of India's major ports. ADB's policy dialogue had
made a positive contribution to this development. The growth in traffic in ADB-assisted ports is
70        Appendix 2

an indicator of the general effectiveness of the assistance. This is demonstrated in Figure A2.2,
which shows a gradual increase in traffic handled at the major ports.6 The fact that the capacity
has also increased indicates the presence of other interventions, including those by the private
sector, to enhance capacity.

18.    All ADB loans in the port subsector were prepaid with the use of lower-cost refinancing.
Overall, ADB's assistance in the ports subsector was well received and helped to develop the
subsector to its present levels. In the case of Loan 1556/1557 to the Mumbai and Chennai ports,
more than 55% of the loan amount was canceled. This reduced the overall effectiveness of the
loans. Although private sector participation has been growing in this subsector, there remain
areas of common infrastructure that require public funding or multilateral assistance.

    ADB's assistance has covered the major ports of Kolkata, Chennai, Cochin, Mumbai, Paradip, and Ennore and one
    minor port of Kakinada. The major ports covered by ADB assistance form the bulk of the traffic growth in India and
    the chart presents a realistic assessment of the effectiveness of ADB's assistance.

20.     TA 10047 covered a study of the role and potential of the port and shipping subsector in
the national economy, including a review of the existing situation, capacity, and constraints
relative to expected traffic up to 2000. Investments for the 8th FYP were to be identified and
evaluated, and priorities established. The institutional framework was to be reviewed, and
improvements recommended as required. No technical assistance completion report was
prepared.

21.     As part of the Second Ports Project,8 TA 12839 provided assistance to Bombay Ports for
its operating and financial management systems. The TA aimed to formulate an action plan to
develop a vessel traffic management system and a computer-based management information
system to enable the Mumbai Port Trust to effectively monitor the financial and operational
performance of its assets. The project performance audit report for Loan 1016 reported that the
TA developed a computerized management information system, which achieved its purpose of
improving the Mumbai Port Trust's operating and financial efficiency.

22.     TA 128410 involved the preparation of an investment program for the 8th FYP (FY1993­
FY1997). This included a study of the organization, institutional framework, and management
and operations of India's ship repair subsector, with a view to achieving more effective and
efficient use of available resources and encouraging greater participation by the private sector.
The project performance audit report for Loan 1016 reported in 2002 that the TA was not
successful, as the implementation of its recommendations proved to be slow and
inconsequential. The country's ship repair subsector remains uncompetitive.

23.      As part of the Coal Ports Project,11 TA 177012 provided assistance to (i) improve the
engineering and financial capabilities of Paradip Port Trust and its ability to prepare corporate
plans; (ii) assist the management of Paradip Port Trust in improving its bulk material handling
operations; (iii) train operating personnel to carry out adequate preventive maintenance on new
coal handling equipment; and (iv) achieve improved, efficient, and effective port performance.
The project completion report for Loan 1181 reported in 2003 that the TA activities were
relevant and consistent with the project's objectives. The Paradip Port Trust implemented the
TA recommendations in the areas of computerization in finance, material management, payroll,
estate management, monitoring operations and controls of the mechanized coal-handling plant
facilities, pollution control and dust suppression arrangements in various sections of
mechanized coal-handling plant facilities, and privatization of its operations. A new tariff
structure for handling coal through a mechanized coal-handling plant was fixed. Also, the
Paradip Port Trust became oriented toward private participation in future port development
activities, including the second mechanized iron ore handling plant and oil jetty, through the
build-operate-transfer route. However, the Paradip Port Trust's ability to produce medium- to
long-term corporate plans remained marginal.

24.      TA 177113 provided assistance in (i) formulating a broad-based strategy for privatization
in the port and shipping subsector; and (ii) developing measures for achieving the goals of
improved capacity, operating efficiency, and productivity to meet user requirements in the 21st
century and reduce public funding. The project completion report for Loan 1181 reported in
2003 that the Government followed the TA recommendations by embarking on an initiative
directed at port privatization and corporatization. Key areas were identified by the Government
for private sector participation in the development and operation of major ports, and guidelines
for inviting private sector participation were issued to various ports. The TA was rated generally
successful in fulfilling the tasks set out, and its recommendations were broadly implemented by
the Government. A new piece of legislation, to succeed the Major Ports Trust Act, 1963,
enabling the privatization initiative was passed by the Government.

25.       TA 276814 was aimed at finalizing project preparatory work for the planned Third Ports
Project. The TA included an analysis of policy issues in the port subsector in the following three
areas: (i) improving the implementation framework for the privatization of the port subsector and
training port trust and Ministry of Surface Transport staff in applying the framework;
(ii) introducing the concept of a commercialization in the port subsector; and (iii) examining
financing opportunities in the port subsector, in both the public and private sectors, in the
medium term (up to 2010). The analysis thus undertaken was intended to provide background
information for the policy agenda to be taken up under the Third Ports Project. No TA
completion report was prepared.

26.     TA 288015 had three main aspects:
        (i)   Commercialization and privatization. This involved (a) assisting the
              Government in strengthening the commercial orientation and performance
              capacity of port trusts by formulating a specific program of changes; (b) assisting
              the Government and the port trusts in strengthening capacity to promote private
              sector participation by formulating specific measures (policy, legal, training,
              financial) that would accelerate privatization; and (c) preparing a model for
              privatization generally applicable to major ports.
        (ii)  Corporatization. This involved (a) preparing a detailed corporatization program
              for the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust; (b) preparing a detailed corporatization
              program for the new port of Ennore, which was being developed under the
              sponsorship of Chennai Port; and (c) preparing a general model for
              corporatization based on the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and Ennore programs.
        (iii) Assistance to the tariff authority for major ports. The assistance to the newly
              established authority covered the formulation of its policies, procedures, criteria,
              and organizational structure.

27.    The TA completion report in 2001 rated TA 2880 generally successful, with an adequate
design and successful implementation within the budget and without any major problems. The
TA responded to the issues related to the corporatization and commercialization of the ports
and terminals, and provided assistance in inviting tenders and evaluating the bids. The
successful implementation was attributed to the consultants' good performance, the satisfactory
cooperation of the officials and staff from the major ports, and ADB's professional approach in
supervising and monitoring the work.

F.       Overall Conclusion

28.     In the port subsector, the completed projects conformed to the Government's goals and
policy, as well as ADB's country operational strategy at the time of appraisal. However, with the
change in ADB's strategy toward commercialization and private sector participation, the
relevance is now somewhat less. In other words, considering the relatively high level of interest
from the private sector, there is less justification for ADB to remain involved in the port
subsector. However, the past assistance in this subsector has conformed to ADB's sector
strategies as well as the country's needs at that time.

29.     With the high rate of growth in the Indian economy, the major ports are under increasing
pressure to handle India's growing trade traffic. The private sector has responded well to the need
to fund and operate the port facilities. However, the expansion of the port facilities would be more
effective if the bottlenecks in port connectivity were resolved. Connectivity to the ports via rail and
road now faces funding problems. This connectivity includes the transport infrastructure between
the ports and the nearest mainline road and rail head. Since this technically falls within the road
and railway subsectors, ADB could explore future funding opportunities along these lines.

30.     In the case of IWT, ADB could provide assistance that serves the general goals of pro-
poor economic growth and regional economic cooperation. The current PPTA in IWT lacks
coherence and faces problems of design and progress. Moreover, unless the more strategic
issues relating to the nature of funding for this subsector and adequate resources within ADB
are sorted out, there is little logic for ADB to continue its operations in the subsector. If future
presence in this subsector is desired, ADB will need to address the strategic as well as project-
level issues before reentering the subsector.

G.       Recommendations

 Port and Inland Waterway Subsectors                                             Responsibility        Timing
 1. Provide Focused Support to Improve Port Connectivity. The port                   SARD         Following the
 subsector in India has benefited in the past from ADB's interventions, TA,                       completion of the
 and loans, which resulted in the provision of the necessary enabling                             India CAPE and
 environment to establish port trusts and PSP. Appendix 12 summarizes                             decisions made

 major ports are under increasing pressure to handle India's growing trade                        preparation of the
 traffic. There has been good response from the private sector in funding                         India country
 and operating the port facilities. However, the connectivity to the ports via                    partnership

 for funding the development of transport infrastructure between the ports
 and the nearest mainline road and railhead could be explored by ADB.
 2. Reassess ADB Presence in IWT Subsector. The recent exit from                   SARD         Following the
 the IWT subsector was prompted by the lack of progress as well as the                          completion of the
 ineffective method of entry into the subsector. The PPTA used for entry                        India CAPE and
 lacked coherence, and there was little progress toward project                                 decisions made
 development. Considering the benefits of subregional connectivity and                          during the
 pro-poor economic growth, this subsector has high potential for                                preparation of the
 development effectiveness. However, unless the more strategic issues                           India country
 relating to the nature of funding for this subsector and adequate                              partnership

 continue its operations in the subsector. If future presence in this
 subsector is desired, ADB will need to address the strategic as well as
 project-level issues before reentering the subsector.

                    EVALUATION FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY

1.       Evaluating the impact of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB's) assistance without
examining the performance of the transport sector as a whole is conceptually impossible, as
ADB's assistance was not undertaken in isolation. Rather, ADB's assistance was accompanied
by investments by other multilateral and bilateral financing institutions, such as the Japan Bank
for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the World Bank, and by the Government. ADB
provided more technical assistance (TA) projects than other development agencies and
financial institutions. These TA projects addressed a range of systemic issues, such as
institutional development; capacity building (contract administration, environment and social
development, corporate finance); private sector participation; toll strategies; commercialization
of operation and maintenance; and road safety. These factors required a systematic evaluation
of the transport sector and developments in the sector over the past 20 years. The impact of
individual projects has been assessed with the use of available information and site visits, and
the results form the basis for evaluating the patterns and common traits of ADB transport sector
projects in India. Comparing individual projects systematically can yield important insights into
the main issues and problems facing the transport sector today. In contrast to a project-level
evaluation, a sector evaluation can help to assess the aggregate potential impact of the projects
and TA on the achievement of sector, rather than project, objectives.

2.      The sector assistance program evaluation (the evaluation) sought to answer the
following broad questions:
        (i)    Bottom-Up Evaluation
               (a)    Relevance. Were the strategies pursued by ADB relevant to:
                      i.     the evolving economic circumstances in India?
                      ii.    ADB's country strategies and programs?
                      iii.   essential sector policy and institutional reforms?
                      iv.    the transport needs perceived by the central and state
                             governments, as well as development plans?
                      v.     the strategies of other development partners?
               (b)    Likely effectiveness. Are ADB's project designs likely to achieve the
                      intended outcomes in light of the perceived effectiveness of the projects?
               (c)    Implementation efficiency. Were or are ADB's operations in the
                      transport sector efficient?
                      i.     Does ADB work effectively with the Government in implementing
                             the projects?
                      ii.    Do ADB's operations ensure efficient procurement?
               (d)    Likely sustainability. Are the planned outputs likely to be sustained?
               (e)    Likely impact. What is the likely impact of road interventions at the local
                      and regional levels?
        (ii)   Top-Down Evaluation
               (a)    ADB's performance. Were ADB's choices of thematic initiatives in the
                      transport sector appropriate?
               (b)    Sector performance. What are the trends in the transport sector?

3.     Since there are not enough completed projects and corresponding outputs, the
evaluation assesses the likely impact of the sector results and their outcomes with the use of
secondary data and a socioeconomic impact assessment of a sample of road projects. Table
A3.1 provides an outline of the evaluation approach adopted by the evaluation.

4.      The evaluation framework (Figure A3) consisted of five building blocks of evaluation, i.e.,
relevance, efficiency, likely efficacy, likely sustainability, and other institutional and development
impacts. For each of these criteria, questions to be addressed through the evaluation were
raised. For example, a key question regarding relevance was: whether the policy objectives
outlined in the country strategies and programs were appropriate for the development context
and strategies of India in the past 17 years. Another question related to relevance was whether
the planned transport sector interventions in the ADB country strategy reflected the policy
objectives. The coordination with other development partners that have been active in this
sector, particularly the World Bank and JBIC, was also assessed. Specific themes that cut
across different evaluation parameters were identified; these included road safety, private sector
participation, and contribution to poverty reduction.

5.     The evaluation relied heavily on discussions with development partners; with ADB and
government officials at the central and state levels; and with a few key stakeholders
(nongovernment organizations, infrastructure financing banks, contractors, and transport
operators).

6.    The methodology is based on a thematic approach focused on the roads and rail
subsectors. This approach includes the following studies:
      (i)     policy level assessment,
      (ii)    technical study,
      (iii)   financial study, and
      (iv)    socioeconomic assessment.
                                                                                    Appendix 3   77


7.      A policy-level assessment of all the subsectors (roads and highways, rail, and, to a limited
extent, inland waterways and ports) was conducted, and the relevance of ADB's strategies was
reviewed against evolving trends in the sector and the Government's policies on transport growth
and management, as reflected in the country's five-year plans.

8.      The assessment included a brief evaluation of the waterway and port subsectors. The
following areas were assessed:
        (i)    ADB's initial strategy in each of these subsectors and the underlying rationale for
               the strategy; and
        (ii)   changes in the subsectors, and development needs where evident.

9.       The evaluation included a technical study to assess the effectiveness with which projects
in the transport sector, primarily in roads and highways and in rail, were being implemented. For
roads and highways, the study identified the bottlenecks in the way of ongoing projects and their
causes. It also assessed compliance with approved road standards (including adequacy of
intersections; safety measures [e.g., crash barriers, warning signs, and special provisions for
roadworks], public transport stops, parking for heavy goods vehicles, and traffic control
devices);1 provisions for pedestrians (including safe-crossing facilities); nonmotorized transport;
and the effectiveness of access control measures on national highways. The environmental
reports guiding ADB's projects were also assessed in the technical study.

10.     The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has embarked on a major expansion
exercise in the national highway subsector. To assess the financial sustainability of the National
Highway Development Program (NHDP), the evaluation included a financial study to assess the
pipeline of capital investment and operation and maintenance requirements. This pipeline was
compared with the available funding in the form of fuel cess and other government allocations as
well as private funds (taking into account the prospects for further private sector growth and
expansion). Experiences with private sector participation were analyzed.

11.     A socioeconomic assessment in selected rural areas of India was part of the evaluation.
It was done to evaluate socioeconomic changes such as livelihood patterns; industrial
development; road safety; environmental issues; HIV/AIDS cases; access to market areas,
community centers, and education and health facilities; and effects on farmgate prices. The
assessment was limited to changes in the road subsector (national roads, state roads, and rural
roads); the rail subsector was excluded. Completed and ongoing road projects funded by ADB
and the Government were assessed. The intent was to assess the wider changes in the road
subsector rather than ADB projects only, on the assumption that non-ADB projects would be
similar to ADB projects and would generate similar socioeconomic changes.

12.    The socioeconomic assessment was based on focus group discussions and key
informant interviews. However, no traffic count studies were conducted. The assessment used
Madhya Pradesh as a sample area for "with project" and "without project" comparisons of rural
roads and state roads. The relative effects of improved connectivity and access for the local
communities were reviewed. The rationale for selecting the various subsectors for this
assessment is summarized below:
       (i)     National highways contribute significantly to the national economy, and indirectly
               affects the local economy through industrialization, greater economic mobility,
               and wider opportunities.

    Including traffic signals, signs, and road markings.
 78      Appendix 3



         (ii)    State highways affect the regional economies and act as critical links between
                 the rural economies and the state and national economies.
         (iii)   Rural roads have significant localized impacts by providing access to the remote
                 rural communities and farmers and bringing them into the economic mainstream
                 in the country.

 13.     Table A3.2 gives details of the roads assessed. The study used the Surat-Manor Tollway
 Project (Loan 1747) in Gujarat as sample national highway. For state roads and rural roads,
 Madhya Pradesh was used as the sample area. The rationale for using Madhya Pradesh is as
 follows:
         (i)    Madhya Pradesh has witnessed a major rural roads program as well as a major
                state roads program, both financed by ADB.
         (ii)   The state has districts (Betul and Chindwara) that have witnessed a high level of
                road improvement activities as part of rural road and state road programs.
         (iii)  These districts also have areas with almost no interventions; these could provide
                a control area.

 14.     The rationale for using the Surat-Manor toll road in Gujarat is as follows:
         (i)    The toll road was recently completed with ADB financing.
         (ii)   The toll road has been developed as a commercially viable national highway in
                line with several other programs of NHAI.
         (iii)  The toll road can be identified as a distinct project connecting centers of
                economic activity.

 15.     The Operations Evaluation Mission gathered information through the following:
         (i)   Interviews and in-depth discussions with key stakeholders in the sector,
               including:

        communities (with and without road or highway access) in states and districts, to
        evaluate how the availability of roads affects people's quality of life and livelihood,
        and to identify the key factors that constrain households without an all-weather
        road connection.

16.      The evaluation of ADB's assistance program met with several methodological
challenges. First, the evaluation hoped to differentiate the performance of ADB-financed
projects from that of transport sector projects in general. Although such a distinction is not
always possible, this evaluation tries to highlight the differences found. Efforts were also made
to distinguish between the impact of external factors, e.g., the Asian financial crisis, and that of
policy and management errors. Second, the task of assessing ADB's assistance over the last
3 decades was complicated by the variation in the performance of ADB-supported projects over
time. Third, the evaluation goes beyond project-level evaluations like those in project
performance evaluation reports (which assess the performance of individual projects) by
assessing the potential cumulative impact of the projects on the achievement of important
sector goals, e.g., reliable and affordable transport services, a financially viable transport sector,
better safety, and, directly and indirectly, poverty reduction.

17.     Although the few project completion reports and project performance audit reports on
transport projects in India (Appendix 2) provided useful information for the evaluation on project
implementation and initial operation, their usefulness for the evaluation was limited for two
reasons. First, the assessment of the economic returns of the projects by project completion
reports and project performance audit reports disclosed the overly optimistic appraisal forecasts.
But since the evaluation did not conduct any traffic studies, these economic analyses could not
be updated to reflect the intervening changes.2 Second, projects may perform well individually
and attain high success rates, yet cumulatively fail to achieve the main sector goals, either
because the sector goals are too ambitious or the individual projects have limited relevance to
their achievement. The evaluation, therefore, tried to draw information from a variety of other
sources besides project completion reports and project performance audit reports. It also relied
on site visits and more updated information on the performance of the sector and ADB-
supported projects to reach a balanced assessment.

18.       Table A3.3 gives the broad evaluation framework that guided the evaluation.

    Even if the evaluation had included traffic studies of the completed projects, the economic benefits would have
    been hard to trace to specific transport projects because there have been other interventions in the projects
    themselves or in the project area.

                           PROFILE OF THE INDIAN TRANSPORT SECTOR

A.          Growth in Transport Sector

1.      The evident economic growth in India over the last 2 decades has increased demand for
all transport services, particularly land transport via road and rail, as shown in Table A4.1.
Vehicle ownership has increased, with the number of private motor cars growing by 16%, two
wheelers by 20%, and goods vehicles by 13% per year from 1991 to 2003.

2.       In the 1990s, as India's economy expanded by 6­7% a year (Table A4.1), transport
demand grew by about 10% yearly. 1 The rate of growth, however, varied by subsector,
reflecting structural changes in demand for different modes, as well as the effect of some
supply-side factors.

3.     Table A4.2 shows the contribution of the transport sector to gross domestic product
(GDP) and the proportion of public expenditures on this sector. The contribution of the transport
sector to the economy is higher than the proportion of expenditures used to improve and
maintain the sector.2

    A World Bank report in 2004 stated that in FY2002, the road sector accounted for slightly less than 3% of
    government expenditure and contributed about 15.5% of revenues. Thus, the road sector generated a large fiscal
    surplus (Source: World Bank. 2004. Highway Sector Financing in India: A Policy Note. Washington, DC).

4.      The road subsector, which already had an estimated 80% share of land transport demand
in 1990, witnessed annual growth of about 12% in freight demand and 8% in passenger demand
(footnote 2) (Figure A4.1). Both air and ocean transport also showed healthy growth, whereas the
demand for rail transport grew more slowly, at just 1.4% a year for freight and 3.6% a year for
passenger traffic. This growth could be attributed to both demand-side and supply-side factors.
On the supply side, intense competition from the mostly privately run road transport services,
coupled with operating inflexibilities and capacity constraints on key Indian Railways routes,
increased the modal share of roads.

5.     The above demand is fueled by sustained economic growth and rising incomes over the
last 2 decades, resulting in rapidly growing vehicle ownership (Table A4.3). The increasing
vehicle ownership is a key factor underlying the rapid traffic growth. But it has also created
congestion on the roads, contributing to longer journey times, higher vehicle operating costs,
higher vehicle emissions, and more traffic accidents. Table A4.4 provides an overview.

B.        Institutional Arrangements

6.     Responsibilities for the transport system in India are divided between the central and state
governments. In broad terms, the central Government is responsible for railways, national
highways, major ports and international shipping, civil aviation, and national inland waterways.
The responsibility for each mode resides with a mode-specific ministry in the central Government.3
Figure A4.2 shows the overall institutional arrangements in the central Government.

7.      Roads. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was created under an act of
Parliament in 1988 to be responsible for developing, maintaining, and managing the national
highway system. Because of lack of funds and a clear organizational strategy, however, NHAI
was not formally established until February 1995. In 1998, NHAI initiated the National Highway
Development Program (NHDP) for the upgrading and widening of the national highways
network. It now implements about $1 billion worth of projects yearly. The Asian Development
Bank (ADB) and the World Bank were catalysts in NHAI's establishment. Aside from providing
loans to set up NHAI, ADB worked closely with the authority over the years in providing
technical assistance projects for institutional development; capacity building (contract
administration, environment and social development, corporate finance); private sector
promotion; toll strategy setting; commercialization of operations and maintenance; and road
safety. NHAI is now implementing 24,000 kilometers (km) out of the total national highways
length of 66,590 km. The development of NHAI has been a major institutional success that has
had a positive impact on the development of the road sector.

8.      States manage their road development activities through their public works departments
(in the case of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, for example) or roads and buildings
departments (in Gujarat and other states). With the support of ADB,4 Madhya Pradesh has
established the Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation to (i) act as the state highway
authority; (ii) develop strategic plans for the state road subsector; (iii) identify and prioritize
projects according to economic, social, technical, and commercial criteria; and (iv) serve as the
nodal agency of the state government in implementing road and related projects under public-
private partnership (PPP) and build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes. The 8,000 km network of
state highways in Madhya Pradesh was transferred to the Madhya Pradesh Road Development
Corporation for development, construction, improvement, and maintenance. It is the executing
agency for the upgrading of 1,750 km of state highways with ADB funding support.5 A similar
road development structure is expected to be used in the neighboring Chhattisgarh state.

9.      Village roads providing local connectivity are managed and maintained by local bodies
(panchayat). The centrally-sponsored rural roads program (e.g., Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak
Yojana [PMGSY]) is managed by the state rural roads development agency under the guidance of
the central National Rural Roads Development Agency. Funding for the PMGSY comes from the
central Government. Roads managed by the public works departments are developed, maintained,
and managed with funds from the state's budget. Some degree of central support to the states for
developing and maintaining their roads comes from the Central Road Fund and the 12th Finance
Commission allocation. However, adequate funding for road maintenance remains a problem.

    There are five central mode specific ministries--the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways; the Ministry
    of Civil Aviation; the Ministry of Railways; the Ministry of Rural Development; and the Ministry of Urban Development.

10.      The Government of India established the Central Road Fund under the Central Road
Fund Act in 2000 as a mechanism for using cess (tax) proceeds exclusively for road
development in the country. An explicit cess6 (or tax) on fuel (petrol and high-speed diesel)
provides the funds for the Central Road Fund. It collects around $1.23 billion yearly. The cess
first flows into the Consolidated Fund of India and is then transferred into the Central Road Fund
with the approval of the Parliament. The Central Road Fund is controlled by the Ministry of
Finance. Its funds are allocated for national, state, and rural roads as defined in the act. For the
national highways, Central Road Fund allocations are earmarked for exclusive use in the
implementation of the NHDP. With this assured revenue stream, the NHAI has been able to
raise debt funds to finance its program. Corresponding allocations for state highways and rural
roads are significant additional resources for these subsectors. The fund differs from the road
funds in other countries in that it is meant for both development and maintenance activities. The
mechanism of allocations to the various subsectors should be made more transparent.

11.     Railways. The Indian Railways is state-owned and operated by the Ministry of Railways.
The Indian Railways' finances are separated from the general budget of the Government, and
its annual requirement for funds is voted through a separate budget presented to the Parliament.
The Ministry of Railways is headed by the minister of railways. The Indian Railways policy is
formulated and managed by the Indian Railways board, comprising a chairman and six
functional members. Wide powers are vested in the board to supervise the running of 16 zonal
railways, a metro railway (Kolkata), production units, construction organizations, and other rail
establishments. Ten subsidiary organizations7 under the Ministry of Railways have specialized
responsibilities for Indian Railways' operations, finance, engineering, and other activities.

12.     The Indian Railways incorporated Rail Vikas Nigam Limited as a special purpose vehicle
to implement some physical improvements in the Indian Railways' National Railway
Development Program (National Rail Vikas Yojana) program, which was supported by ADB.8
Rail Vikas Nigam Limited's responsibilities include project development and resource
mobilization for commercially run projects, using largely nonbudgetary funds. To mobilize
alternative sources of funding, the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited implements BOT projects with
funding from various development partners, and raises funds in the capital and debt markets.

C.         Current Developments in the Subsectors

           1.       Roads
13.     The road network currently cannot handle high traffic density and has poor surface quality.
Nearly 38% of the national highways network is single-lane, while about 59% is double-lane. State
highways and major district roads account for about 13% of the road network and 40% of traffic.
While inadequate supply of funds is acknowledged as the main issue, the Government has been
making efforts to improve the overall network through public as well as private sector funding.

14.      In the road subsector, there is inconsistency in the distribution of public spending
between segments. Revenue in the subsector comes from various sources: vehicles taxes (on
the initial purchase) and annual fees; fuel taxes imposed by both the central Government and
6
     The cess was initially set at Rs1 per liter, for both gasoline and diesel, and then increased to Rs1.50 per liter
     ($0.03 per liter) in 2003. In 2004, $438 million from the Central Road Fund went to the construction and
     maintenance of national highways, $222 million to state highways, and $511 million to rural roads (Source: Ministry
     of Finance). Some states have introduced additional fuel cess. Uttar Pradesh, for example, has imposed an
     additional sales tax of 4% on diesel, and 6% on gasoline, raising about $55 million per year for the road sector.

the state governments; road tolls; and direct taxes on road freight and passengers. The revenue
from these different sources is collected in a central pool,9 from which expenditures are funded.
In 2002, the revenue from road user charges was $3.3­$4.4 billion. Road subsector revenues
and expenditure among the different segments that year were as follows:10
        (i)    Highways. Road user charges ($2.2 billion) exceeded expenditures ($1.4 billion).
               There could be a broad balance if the highways were adequately maintained.
        (ii)   District and rural roads. Road user charges ($748 million) were below
               expenditure ($1.4 billion).
        (iii)  Urban roads. Road user charges were substantially greater than urban road
               expenditure.

                a.      National Highways

15.     NHAI has initiated a massive NHDP as summarized below:
        (i)   NHDP I. Four-laning of the Golden Quadrilateral. This first phase of the NHDP
              will link the four metropolitan cities--Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai.
        (ii)  NHDP II. Four-laning of the North-South and East-West corridors. The North-South
              corridor connects Srinagar to Kanyakumari including the Kochi-Salem spur, and
              the East-West corridor connects Silchar to Porbandar. This second phase of the
              NHDP will also cover port connectivity and other national highway projects.
        (iii) NHDP III. Four-laning of high-density national highways totaling 10,000 km. This
              phase is to be implemented through the BOT mode. The stretches of national
              highways covered carry high volume of traffic, connect state capitals with the
              network established in the first two phases, and provide connectivity to places of
              economic, commercial, and tourist importance;
        (iv)  NHDP IV. Two-laning of 20,000 km of national highways to provide balanced and
              equitable distribution of the improved highway network throughout the country.
              Capacity, speed, and safety on the new two-lane highways will match the
              minimum benchmarks for the entire national highways network.
        (v)   NHDP V. Six-laning of 6,500 km of four-lane national highways comprising the
              Golden Quadrilateral and other high-density stretches, through PPP on a BOT
              basis. These corridors are now being four-laned under NHDP I, and the program
              for their six-laning was to begin in 2006 and to be completed by 2012. Of the
              6,500 km proposed under NHDP V, about 5,700 km will be taken up in the
              Golden Quadrilateral and the remaining 800 km would be selected on the basis
              of approved eligibility criteria.
        (vi)  NHDP VI. Development of 1,000 km of expressways on a BOT basis to serve the
              growing urban centers, particularly those located within a few hundred kilometers
              of each other. These expressways will be built on new alignments.
        (vii) NHDP VII. Other highway projects--ring roads, bypasses, grade separators, and
              service roads--considered necessary for the full use of highway capacity and for
              enhanced safety and efficiency.

16.     The NHDP is by far the largest national highways rehabilitation program of the Government.
It currently covers 17,161 km11 and is being expanded in phases, as mentioned above. The
Government originally intended to complete the Golden Quadrilateral by December 2003, but has
had to postpone the deadline several times because of problem projects. Under a revised schedule,
about 92% of the Golden Quadrilateral was to have been completed by December 2005, but only
10% of the North-South/East-West corridor improvements had been completed by 28 February

9
   The Central Road Fund has been set up by the Government to streamline funding for road rehabilitation and
   maintenance in India.

2005. The completion deadline of December 2006 was also not met. Full completion is now
expected by December 2007. Meeting even this deadline will be a challenge.

17.     The four-laning of 10,000 km of national highways by March 2010 under NHDP III is to
be achieved entirely via BOT agreements to avoid the use of budget funds. A special
accelerated road development program for the Northeastern Region (NHDP-Northeast),
involving 7,639 km or roads (3,251 km of national highways and 4,388 km of other roads), is
included, to improve connectivity in the northeastern states. The network is expected to
accelerate development in this remote, underprivileged region.

18.    Road connectivity to major ports is a vital part of a trade development initiative that will
decongest growing port areas to facilitate the movement of bulk cargo and containers at India's
major ports. The Port Connectivity Project, under the NHDP, involves improving national highway
connections to 10 major ports--Chennai, Haldia, Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Kandla, Kochi, Mangalore,
Mormugao, Paradip, Tuticorin, and Visakhapatnam. The project is expected to be completed in 2007.
               b.       State Highways
19.     State highways and major district roads vary widely in their condition and stage of
development from state to state. With the central Government increasingly focused on national
highways, the state highway subsector tends to depend on the state governments for funding.
Accruals from the Central Road Fund are inadequate to finance the needs of the subsector. A
larger portion of state funding, however, goes to rural roads because of the increasing need to
address rural development issues. As a result, state governments are increasingly looking to the
private sector to fund state highways.
20.   Table A4.5 shows the states that involve the private sector in road projects, mainly state
highways:

             c.         Rural Roads
21.     India has a rural road network of more than 2.70 million km. Earth tracks that do not
meet the road technical standards make up more than 1 million km of this total. Rural roads
have suffered from unsystematic planning. With several agencies involved in developing and
maintaining these roads, there was no uniform development of a network. Rural road
development was traditionally perceived more as employment generation than as an activity
that provided all-weather means of access.
22.    PMGSY was launched in December 2000 as the first attempt to systematize the rural
road development effort. The PMGSY is guided by the following considerations:
       (i)   Rural roads will provide farm-to-market all-weather connectivity for all habitations with
             a population of at least 500 (at least 250 for hill states and desert and tribal areas).
                                                                                                                     Appendix 4   91
           (ii)       The program will include network augmentation as well as modernization.
           (iii)      New connectivity will be provided to (a) 60,000 habitations with a population of at
                      least 1,000, (b) 81,000 habitations with a population of at least 500, and
                      (c) 29,000 habitations with a population of at least 250.
           (iv)       The upgrading of about 370,000 km of rural roads is expected to cost about
                      $11.6 billion.
           (v)        New connectivity is expected to cost about $17.3 billion.
           (vi)       About $13.2 billion in total expenditure is planned until 2010; further additions will
                      be planned after that.
           (vii)      The total estimated cost of the entire project is about $29 billion.
23.      The PMGSY is a massive program, running in parallel to the NHDP. Although the overall
design of the program is sound in its institutional and progress monitoring arrangements, project
prioritization is muddled. This is because the first projects were identified on the basis of
unreliable data on habitations. The PMGSY guidelines were also changed a number of times,
causing uncertainty in implementation. As a result, several low-priority projects were
implemented at the start, on the assumption that these had high priority. These initial problems
appear to have been addressed, although progress has been slow.
           2.         Railways
24.    The Indian Railways owns and operates one of the largest rail networks in the world,
spreading over 63,140 route-km. Passenger traffic increased from 66 billion passenger-km in
1950­1951 to 457 billion in 2000­2001, while freight traffic during the same period increased
from 44 billion net ton-km to 315 billion. However, between 1970­1971 and the late 1990s, the
share of railways in the freight traffic market dropped from 65.5% to around 48.0% and its share
in passenger traffic, from 32.9% to 23.0% (Figure A4.3).12

25.     At present, the Indian Railway's freight and passenger revenues are increasing as traffic
flows on both rail and road grow, reflecting India's economic growth. The growth in traffic could
be attributed to both demand-side and supply-side factors. While there was a major increase in
demand for both freight and passenger services, the Indian Railways also initiated several
measures to regain its lost share of the market. The improvement in the operations of the Indian
Railways are shown in Table A4.6.

26.    However, market-oriented reforms are still needed to ensure that the performance can
be sustained and can improve further. The implementation of the reforms has been delayed. For
example: (i) consultants for the cost accounting system took an exceptionally long time to be
appointed; and (ii) the Indian Railways has expressed reservations about doing a study for a
regulatory authority.

27.      In 2002, the Government initiated the National Rail Vikas Yojana13 to remove capacity in
critical sections of the Indian Railways network. It has three components:
         (i)     Strengthening of Golden Quadrilateral rail services and diagonals;
         (ii)    Strengthening of rail connectivity to ports and development of multimodal
                 corridors to the hinterland; and
         (iii)   Construction of four major bridges, namely, (a) Bogibeel, a rail and road bridge
                 across the Brahmaputra river; (b) Munger, a rail and road bridge across the
                 Ganga river; and (c) Patna Ganga bridge and a bridge over the Kosi river.

28.     The Ministry of Railways has formulated an integrated modernization plan for 2005­
2006 to 2009­2010 to upgrade the Indian Railways operations, including both passenger and
freight services, to modern global standards. The total expenditure involved would be about
$5.5 billion. In keeping with the broad concept of NHAI's Golden Quadrilateral and to enable the
Indian Railways to compete with the road transport services using the upgraded national
highways network, the Ministry of Railways has announced the launching of dedicated freight
corridors. These would consist of new tracks exclusively laid for freight trains along the Golden
Quadrilateral, thereby enabling freight trains to travel at speeds of more than 100 km an hour
and helping to decongest rail traffic. On the present network, passenger and freight trains move
on the same track, causing delays and increasing the risk of accidents.

29.     The Indian Railways plans to use a number of PPP models to enhance its capacity and
improve the services: (i) a special-purpose vehicle involving various stakeholders, including
state governments; (ii) BOT; (iii) private freight terminals; and (iv) a wagon investment scheme.
The special-purpose vehicle scheme envisages the participation of the private sector and other
beneficiaries and national-level infrastructure funding institutions in the development of railway
infrastructure through concessions. The concession period can be fairly long (e.g., 33 years)
and can be extended further. Indian Railways will also be involved in such projects with the help
of state governments. While this model shares the revenues with the Indian Railways, the BOT
model transfers more risks to the concessionaire. The BOT model envisages private sector
participation through a consortium of construction contractors and financers. Under the BOT
scheme, the concessionaire will design, build, and operate the facility. After the concession

period, the facility will be transferred back to the Indian Railways. The Indian Railways will also
encourage the private sector to develop freight terminals, with Indian Railways paying service
charges to compensate for the capital cost, and the private sponsor allowed to charge
customers separately for services such as handling, loading and unloading, warehousing, and
transport.

30.       To encourage PPP in wagon procurement to meet the anticipated demand for rail freight
traffic, the Indian Railways announced a new wagon investment scheme during the 2005­2006
budget presentation. This approach focuses on a guaranteed number of wagons every month to
a customer based on the number of wagons procured. Also, freight concessions will be awarded
to participating customers. The wagons can be procured by individuals, corporate bodies, or
associations or groups of companies. The customers can procure the wagons directly from the
builders approved by the Ministry of Railways, subject to the use of the current Indian Railways
standard design and specifications and inspection by the agency nominated by the Indian
Railways. It remains to be seen, however, whether the Indian Railways' new initiatives to attract
private capital will be more successful than previous schemes.

31.     In 2002, the Government set up a special railway safety fund to replace old assets
including tracks, bridges, rolling stock, signaling equipment, and other safety enhancement
items. However, funding was reduced from $802 million in 2005­2006 to $462 million in 2006­
2007 despite the backlog in track renewal and bridge rehabilitation. The Indian Railways has
attributed the reduction in allocation to a decrease in the volume of civil works.

D.        Implementation of Railways Reforms

32.     Excerpts from Rakesh Mohan Committee Report14 in 2001 suggested that the driving
factor behind restructuring of the Indian Railways needs to be the adoption of a commercial
orientation. One of the major challenges of commercialization of the railways is to shift the
culture and mindset from a bureaucracy into a market savvy and customer-oriented, profit-
driven business. With diminishing subsidies and budget allocations, this appeared to be the only
route to self-sufficient viability. The report suggested that the Indian Railways needs to review
its governance structure; governance which defines the roles and institutional relationships
associated with policy, regulation, and management.

33.    The Indian Railways did initiate several measures to adopt a commercially oriented way
of conducting business. These included:
       (i)     Commercial development of railways land and air space as one of the nontariff
               measures to generate revenues.
       (ii)    Increase in permissible axle load to 22.9 tons and in some cases to 25 tons,
               although this is well short of the 30-ton norm in other countries.
       (iii)   Introduction of roll-on roll-off services on the Konkan Railways, tied-up with the
               Central Warehousing Corporation to provide more value added services as well
               as door-to-door transportation of freight.

34.     Overall, the Indian Railways did implement some of the reforms suggested by the
Rakesh Mohan Committee but did not touch upon the core issues such as revamping the
organizational structure, transparent tariff mechanism, and internal product-oriented
reorganization. It could be argued that the Indian Railways has gained a lot in the short term but
could hit a growth ceiling when the internal slack capacity is fully squeezed out. It is important
for Indian Railways to progress further on implementation of reforms. It is indeed difficult for

     Railways chaired by Rakesh Mohan.
94     Appendix 4

such a huge organization to change in the face of competition from roads and airlines. However,
with adequate political will and ownership, this could be achieved.

E.     Tenth Five-Year Plan: Description

35.    The 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2002­2007) for the transport sector has adopted these
broad policy objectives in response to the growing demand in the sector:
       (i)     Ensuring transport growth in such a way as to enable all regions to participate in
               economic development, with special attention to the integration of remote regions
               like the North-East into the economic mainstream;
       (ii)    Augmenting capacity, improving quality and productivity through technology
               upgrade, and modernizing operation;
       (iii)   Emphasizing higher maintenance standards to reduce the need for frequent
               rebuilding;
       (iv)    Generating more financial resources internally and increasing private sector
               participation in transport service provisions;
       (v)     Increasing overall economic efficiency by bringing competition into the provision
               and maintenance of transport infrastructure and services;
       (vi)    Giving more emphasis to safety, energy efficiency, environmental conservation,
               and beneficial social impact; and
       (vii)   Developing an optimal intermodal mix, where each mode operates efficiently and
               according to its comparative advantage, and complements the services provided
               by other modes of transport.

F.     Midterm Appraisal

36.      To assess the overall progress made on the various plans and programs, the Planning
Commission undertook a midterm appraisal of the 10th FYP in 2006. Its overall assessment of
the growth in rail and port traffic from 2002 to 2004 was that "plan targets are likely to be
achieved or even exceeded," with Indian Railways having recorded some improvement in
financial performance. However, the commission also found that the Indian Railways' prescribed
targets for internal and extra-budgetary resources would be difficult to achieve. In the road
subsector, the four-laning and six-laning of the Golden Quadrilateral was behind schedule, the
appraisal found, but work relating to the strengthening of weak pavement and the improvement
of the riding quality of roads was ahead of target. The outlook for the various subsectors as
outlined in the midterm appraisal report is summarized in Box A4. The 11th FYP is expected to
be in line with this outlook.
                                                                                                     Appendix 4        95

                  Box A4: Outlook for Indian Roads, Railways, and Ports from 2006
 Roads
  The Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways (MoSRTH) should prepare a detailed, 2-year program to
  optimize the use of available budgetary support for a mix of engineering, procurement, construction, and build-
  operate-transfer (BOT) projects;
  MoSRTH should prepare targets and milestones to enable the monitoring of programs, including the National
  Highway Development Program (NHDP);
  A model concession agreement should be developed for BOT projects;
  The institutional capacity of the National Highways Authority of India to establish a multidisciplinary, professional
  body with high-quality financial management and contract management expertise should be enhanced;
  A committee of secretaries must address interministerial issues, including bottlenecks in ongoing projects;
  A system should be developed for collecting and analyzing traffic information and inventorying the condition of
  assets;
  A model concession agreement on the operation and maintenance and tolling of completed stretches of the NHDP
  should be drawn up;
  A dedicated organization for road safety and traffic management should be set up;
  A law should be passed for economic regulation and the resolution of disputes in public-private partnerships
  (PPPs); and
  Leverage the cess amount from the Central Road Fund available for the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
  (PMGSY) for raising resources.

 Railways
  An integrated modernization plan based on transport corridors should be implemented;
  The investment strategy should be rationalized by linking future investments with improvements in capacity and in
   the quality of services;
  The Ministry of Railways and the Planning Commission should collaborate in preparing a paper on tariff setting,
   including the need for a rail tariff authority;
  Organizational reforms should be carried out to set up a fully computerized accounting system conforming with
   international accounting practices; make production units profit centers; grant concessions to the private sector to
   operate uneconomic lines; and outsource noncore activities;
  PPPs should be encouraged in the development of high-density corridors, tourist trains, additional goods trains
   serving major commercial and industrial centers, collieries, and power stations;
  Competition in container movement should be allowed; and
  A time-based plan should be formulated for increasing capacity on specific congested routes to meet the increasing traffic.

 Ports
  The scope of private sector participation in the development of ports should be increased;
  Ports should be corporatized to encourage efficient management, institutional funding, and private investment;
  The role of Tariff Authority for Major Ports should be reviewed;
  The productivity of major ports should be improved through technology upgrades;
  Manning scales should be rationalized to improve port productivity; and
  Perspective plans for the long-term development of each major port should be prepared.

G.      South Asia Regional Economic Cooperation

37.     The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program, which was
launched in 2001 with ADB assistance, provides a forum for the four countries in the region
(Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal) to discuss, identify, and prioritize subregional
cooperation projects in the six priority sectors--transport; energy and power; environment;
information and communications technology; tourism, trade, and investment; and private sector
cooperation. Some difficulties were encountered during the initial implementation of SASEC but
overall progress has improved more recently. Cooperation in transport has progressed, with a
framework being developed for subregional connectivity involving 21 corridors (existing and
actual), six of which have been identified as priority corridors for upgrading to improve
connectivity in the subregion. ADB intends to provide loan assistance selectively for the
upgrading of some segments of these corridors. Other activities include broadening the scope of
work of SASEC's Transport Working Group to cover interregional transport issues, specifically
the establishment of closer links between SASEC and the Greater Mekong Subregion initiative.
96         Appendix 4


38.    The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation
(BIMSTEC) was formed in December 1997 by Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and
Thailand and has emerged as an important cross-regional cooperative initiative joining countries
in South Asia and the Greater Mekong Subregion. All SASEC members are now also members of
BIMSTEC. At the first BIMSTEC Summit in July 2004, a program for economic cooperation was
set out in six sectors: trade and investment, energy, tourism, transport and communications,
technology, and fisheries. India is leading the initiatives in tourism, transport, and communications.

39.     These subregional efforts are intended to (i) encourage strong political commitment from
the participating countries; (ii) identify and implement quick-yielding projects to demonstrate
tangible benefits within a short time frame; (iii) establish core working groups with the financial
and technical support required to advance project cooperation to achieve the goals of regional
cooperation; (iv) ensure the right balance between improving hard and soft infrastructure;
(v) mobilize resources for regional cooperation, dependent on identifying sound and viable
projects that offer clear and tangible benefits to the countries involved; and (vi) involve the
private sector in regional cooperation activities as the promoter of trade, financier of
infrastructure projects (e.g., roads), and facilitator of the regional cooperation process.

40.       An international north-south transport corridor is planned between India, the Russian
Federation, and Iran, using Indian ports to provide outlets to the Indian Ocean. The agreement
among the three countries provides a shorter route to Moscow via Bunder Abbas, Bunder Anzali,
the Caspian Sea, and Astrakhan, and beyond via Iran. Ongoing studies are exploring various
bottlenecks on the route in terms of time, cost, efficiency, risks, information flow, customs
requirements, other procedures, etc., and will suggest practical solutions to overcome these
difficulties.

41.     In the case of the Indian transport sector, there are several potential areas where the
above initiatives could bear fruit. For landlocked countries like Bhutan and Nepal, transit through
India and Bangladesh is essential to promote economic development. Road connectivity
between India and the People's Republic of China via Nepal could significantly increase trade
and investment among the three countries. For the northeastern states of India, transit through
Bangladesh can significantly reduce the cost of access to the sea and to neighboring countries
and beyond. Inland water transport using the Ganga-Meghna-Brahmaputra river system could
be effective in improving the freight transport system in the region. A recent ADB study15
suggested that rehabilitation and improvement in inland water transport facilities in this water
basin between India and Bangladesh could reduce the cost of trade between the two countries.
Similarly, the technical standardization of the railway system between Bangladesh, India, and
Pakistan could significantly reduce the costs of transportation, by substituting a land route for
the current long and costly transport through congested seaports.

H.         The Way Forward

42.    For the 11th FYP (2007­2012), the Planning Commission prepared an approach paper in
June 2006. This official paper of the Government indicated that infrastructure inadequacies in
both rural and urban areas are a major constraint on India's growth."16

43.     The approach paper indicated that for India to achieve the expected continued growth in
GDP of about 9% per year, investment in infrastructure (including road, rail, air, and water
transport) will need to be increased. Recognizing that this would place a heavy burden on
scarce public sector resources, the approach paper advocates the promotion of PPPs for many
infrastructure investments.

44.    In the road and highway subsector, the approach paper reaffirmed the NHDP program
under NHAI, with its further expansion to include NHDP V (6,500 km six-laning of the Golden
Quadrilateral), NHDP VI (1,000 km of expressways during the 12th FYP period), and NHDP VII
(consisting of bypasses and ring roads, with priorities, total length, and other details still to be
determined). All NHDP contracts from NHDP III onward would be awarded only on a BOT basis,
with traditional engineering, procurement, and construction contracts awarded only in
exceptional cases. The paper also reaffirmed an acceleration of the PMGSY program to
connect with all-weather rural roads by 2008­2009 all communities with a population of 1,000 or
more (500 or more for hilly and tribal areas).

45.      Priority will be given in the 11th FYP to ensure the integrated development of the road
network, including state highways, major district roads, and other district road within the
jurisdiction of the state governments, together with the rural roads system.

46.   Other new initiatives in the road subsector that are expected to be included in the 11th
FYP are as follows:
      (i)      More attention to road and bridge maintenance activities, with additional funding

      (ii)     Restructuring of NHAI to strengthen the professional skills of its staff and provide
               the organization with a greater measure of autonomy and accountability; and
      (iii)    Establishment of an organization dedicated to the promotion of road safety, in
               recognition of the enormous human and economic losses caused by the very
               high number of serious traffic accidents on Indian roads. In addition, 1% of the
               fuel cess is to be earmarked for safety-related measures.

47.     In the railway subsector, the paper recognized the progress made by the Indian
Railways in 2005­2006 because of improved productivity, but also noted that capacity
bottlenecks and constraints still exist within the system--particularly affecting the efficient
movement of containers to and from the major ports. During the 11th FYP, dedicated rail freight
corridors will be developed on critical routes (e.g., Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Howrah). The paper
also postulated that opening container services to more service providers would improve levels
of service and enable Indian Railways to regain some of its lost market share.

48.    In the past few decades, consistent with worldwide experience, the railway subsector
has lost its share of the freight and passenger markets to roads. For example, the Indian
Railways' share of the total cement transportation fell from a monopolistic 80% 3 decades ago
to about 40% in 2001.17 The Poulose Committee report of 1995 indicated that Indian Railways'
competitiveness with respect to long-distance freight haulage had been reduced from an
absolute advantage over road freight for distances over 250 km to an advantage on distances
over 750 km, i.e., Indian Railways was steadily losing traffic to roads in the range between
250 km and 750 km. There has been a growing awareness within Indian Railways of the need
to reverse this trend. The 2006­2007 budget announced various policy- and tariff-related
measures to recover the market share, such as PPPs in customer amenities and rationalized
passenger tariffs. These are in line with these overarching initiatives that are expected to be
included in the 11th FYP:
       (i)     Various steps to improve levels of service, including the establishment of logistic
               parks and terminals, the rationalization of freight structures, and increased use of
               information technology-enabled services;
       (ii)    Focus on the use of PPP in building and operating selected railway infrastructure
               to increase capacity; and

       (iii)   More attention to steps to modernize the railway, including the provision of good-
               quality passenger amenities at terminals, modern rolling stock, and
               improvements in sanitation, and modified wagon designs to increase payload-to-
               tare ratios.

49.     Since 2004, rail tariffs have been set with a conscious focus on the market. Bulk
commodities such as iron ore, cement, petroleum, and iron and steel saw a reduction in tariff
and an increase in the share of freight carried by the Indian Railways in 2005­2006. Combined
with the major initiative of increased axle loading, the Indian Railways managed a 10.8%
increase in loading and 17.9% increase in freight revenue. This resulted in net revenue of
$1.76 billion and an investible surplus of $2.86 billion in 2005­2006. These figures are a
significant increase from 2004 to 2005. Similar growth is expected for 2006­2007.

50.      Despite this progress, the Indian Railways has a long way to go before it can recover its
share of the passenger and freight transport market. The Planning Commission's approach
paper for the 11th FYP suggests that consideration should be given to ways of reorganizing
Indian Railways' structure to enable more focus and concentration on the core activities of the
provision of infrastructure and rail operations. The paper suggests that the manufacture and
maintenance of rolling stock should be corporatized, and some other current Indian Railways
activities outsourced. The paper also addresses passenger and freight tariff rationalization to
counter the apparent loss of overcharged rail passengers to improving air services, and
overcharged rail freight users to road transport services. To achieve a rational pricing basis for
rail services, the paper emphasizes the need to establish a rail tariff regulatory authority.

                           TRANSPORT SECTOR MONITORING FRAMEWORK

A.         Risks, Performance Monitoring, and Evaluation1

1.     The 2003­2006 country strategy and program for India is based on past performance,
needs, and assessment of the country's absorptive capacity. The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) is supposed to monitor risks and to make midcourse corrections as required. These
changes may also be required in response to changing conditions, including new policy
developments. ADB's assessment of the main risks and associated mitigating factors is
summarized in Table A5.1:

                  Table A5.1: ADB Program in India--Risks and Mitigating Factors
    Risk and Risk Assessment                                       Mitigating Factors
    External shocks such as war,       Exogenous risks cannot be fully eliminated. However, large stocks of food
    drought, oil shock (medium risk)   and foreign exchange are strong mitigating factors.

2.      ADB monitors country and portfolio performance using four blocks of performance
indicators, which are reflected in the poverty reduction partnership agreement:
        (i)    Block 1 consists of macroeconomic targets (growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, public
               debt) and the balance-of-payments outlook (current account balance and foreign
               exchange reserves position). The targets are derived from the 10th Five-Year
               Plan, budget documents, and the central bank's policy announcements.
        (ii)   Block 2 consists of poverty reduction and other human development targets
               adopted for the 10th Five-Year Plan and Millennium Development Goals.
        (iii)  Block 3 consists of the reform milestones and other sector performance targets
               indicated in the sector road maps (see following).
        (iv)   Block 4 consists of the loan and technical assistance pipeline, which is updated
               in annual country strategy and program updates, and portfolio performance
               indicators. This figure should have been reduced to not more than 10% by 2006.
               Disbursement and contract award performance should be maintained
               consistently above the ADB norm.

3.      Country program and portfolio performance is evaluated against annual or medium-term
targets set for each block, which is reflected in the poverty reduction partnership agreement.
According to ADB's business processes, the regional management team is primarily responsible
for implementing the program, supported by the country team. The teams closely monitor
the performance indicators to ensure the successful implementation of the country strategy
and program.

B.     Implementation and Monitoring

4.      To secure the smooth implementation of projects, ADB has taken a number of actions
with respect to preparatory processes:
        (i)    establishing a project implementation unit before loan effectiveness;
        (ii)   implementing advance procurement actions and award of civil works contracts
               before loan effectiveness;
        (iii)  ensuring that utilities and other encumbrances are removed before construction;
               and
        (iv)   increasing the size of civil works contracts to avoid a large number of small
               contracts.

5.     Entering new subsectors or extending assistance to new executing agencies would
hinder smooth project implementation. ADB will also attempt to secure the firm commitment of
the Government to implement institutional and policy reforms in a timely manner, and make sure
to secure local counterpart funds before committing itself to extend a loan to the Government.

6.      Increased efforts have been made to develop a more consistent and measurable set of
performance monitoring indicators, as shown in Tables A5.2­A5.4 for the transport sector
modes of current interest to ADB. For instance, for the road sector, a uniform set of indicators
will be used for the systematic collection of data, to be adopted for monitoring purposes by ADB
and the World Bank.

                                  i.       Loan 918-IND: Road Improvement Project

       3.       The project completion report rated the first ADB road improvement loan project "generally
       successful." Although the recalculated overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was high, it
       was lower (22.4%) than at appraisal (35.7%) because of delays in implementation, construction cost
       increases, and lower-than-expected traffic growth. The evaluation team assessed the findings of the
       project completion report and found them to be generally valid. The total number of traffic accidents
       increased significantly in 1995­1998 in all states where roads were improved, but traffic fatality rates
       decreased by over 50% in all states since the road improvements had included the construction of
       road dividers. A 2001 project performance audit report1 for this project assessed it as successful. It
       concluded that the project was relevant, in that it had contributed to the Government of India's
       efforts to improve the road network; that it was effective, as transport constraints had eased and
       vehicle operating cost savings had been realized; and that it had promising prospects for
       sustainability because the completed roads were being relatively well maintained in spite of
       constraints on maintenance funding. Institutional benefits were incidental, with the executing
       agencies only learning from mistakes made during implementation, and the intended developmental
       impacts from the technical assistance (TA) did not materialize. However, the recalculated overall
       EIRR in the project performance audit report (PPAR) was 20.7%, with one road section at less than
       12%. These findings of the PPAR were validated by the evaluation team and the project is rated
       efficient.

       4.     This loan included a TA,2 which concluded that decisions for maintaining roads in both
       Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu continued to be made on standard norms rather than using the
       pavement management system that had been developed by the TA. The TA completion report
       concluded that the TA had been unable to institutionalize or generate ownership of the pavement
       management system within the two states, although the public works departments (PWDs) had
       gained some awareness of the benefits of having systematic road maintenance management
       systems.

       5.      The evaluation team inspected one of the subprojects linking Ballabhgarh with Mathura
       in Uttar Pradesh, part of NH2 linking Delhi with Agra. There has been an increase in the traffic
       on this route, which caters to the tourists traveling to Agra. During the inspection between Delhi

areas operating as four-lane, undivided highways. In several peri-urban areas, the service roads
were almost fully occupied by parked trucks awaiting repair at the many repair shops located
along the road. At the border between Delhi and Haryana state, the evaluation team observed
the considerable congestion caused by vehicles parked on the carriageway, while drivers had to
find off-road offices to pay the border-crossing fees. This operation causes congestion and is an
undesirable, time-consuming process.
                             ii.      Loan 1041-IND: Second Road Improvement Project

6.      The project completion report for the second road loan project gave it a "partly successful"
rating, mainly because of time and cost overruns. The recalculated EIRR was only 12.4%,
compared with the 43.1% estimated at appraisal, because of the start-up delays, lower-than-
expected traffic volumes, contractor issues, and institutional weaknesses in the executing
agencies (particularly the PWDs administering the state road components). There were also
problems with the detailed project report. These included field surveys during construction start-up
not matching the detailed project report planning, rail-over-road bridge complications (involving
the Indian Railways), and safety issues during construction that were not addressed in the road
designs. Despite these delays, the project did result in an EIRR that was slightly more than ADB's
12% benchmark. For this reason, the project is rated efficient.

7.      The project completion report noted that traffic fatalities had decreased significantly from
1993 to 1999 on the improved sections of NH47 in Kerala (by 40%), but had increased slightly on
the improved sections of NH8 in Rajasthan. The reasons for this related to the lack of road safety
awareness of local road users in Rajasthan. The evaluation team has validated the findings of the
project completion report.

8.      The problems experienced during these initial roads and highways projects had been
anticipated by ADB's transportation specialists.4 The situation today shows that while there has
been some improvement, much work remains to be done before implementation delays are
eliminated.

                             iii.     Loan 1274-IND: National Highways Project
9.      Approved in November 1993, the project was delayed by more than 2 years with loan
closure in December 2002 and with higher completion cost attributed to price escalation, delays,
and increase in scope of works. Despite the requirements that project completion reports be
prepared within 12­24 months of loan closing, no project completion report has been prepared
for this project. The loan was prepaid in 2003 with the Government accessing lower-cost
refinancing. The project faced initial delays pending the establishment of the National Highways
Authority of India (NHAI), which were worsened by problems with procurement and land
acquisition. The loan covenant relating to the use of axle load enforcement equipment was not
complied with. Without a project completion report and an economic analysis, the process
efficiency of the project was assessed to be poor. The base EIRR at appraisal was estimated at

    ADB. 1988. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and
    Technical Assistance Grants to India for the Road Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 918-IND, for $198 million,
    approved on 10 November) included a 111-km section between Ballabhgarh and Mathura on the Delhi-Agra NH2.

    An ADB internal report in October 1992 cautioned that it would be difficult to build a new road construction industry
    overnight through such massive projects (Loans 918-IND and 1041-IND). While the staff concerned felt that the
    construction industry would develop ultimately for the initial projects, the report said that ADB must accept that
    there will be delays, and probably failures.
                                                                                 Appendix 6     109


37%. Allowing for optimistic forecasts, project delays, and lower traffic growth, the EIRR at
completion could still be above the benchmark 12%. In view of this, the project is rated efficient.

                       iv.    Loan 1747-IND: Surat-Manor Tollway Project

10.      The project (Loan 1747) was completed in late 2005, after a delay of 15 months.
Besides contractor problems, this overrun could be attributed to the increase in the scope of
works. The evaluation team visited the Surat-Manor Tollway (NH8) in Maharashtra and Gujarat
states (see photographs in Appendix 14). The highway was developed from its original two-lane
configuration in three packages, the first of which was completed in 2003 and the last two in
2005. The four-lane, dual-carriageway tollway was found to be in generally good condition, with
good lane marking and edge delineation, but insufficient signage and inconsistent use of
language on signs to inform the public of safety measures, emergency telephone numbers, etc.
There are safety concerns regarding uncontrolled intersections, the several median openings,
the hazardous end treatment of crash barriers, the unconstrained roaming of cattle on the
highway, and the limited number of crossing facilities for pedestrians in urban areas. NHAI
traffic data indicate that current traffic levels are less than expected (an average two-way
average daily traffic in 2005 of about 21,000 vehicles per day on the busiest section, against an
original estimate of 28,000 vehicles per day by 2007, with annual average growth rates of 6­
8%). Trucks made up 35­76% of the total traffic flow in 2003, with the highest percentages
closest to Mumbai. Truck traffic has reduced in percentage terms since 1997 (by 6­10%), with
the highest traffic flow growth being in private cars, jeeps, and sports utility vehicles (an
increase of 30­112%).

11.       The project EIRR estimated at appraisal was 25%. Considering the lower growth in
traffic, the EIRR should be less than 25% at completion, but is likely to be above the benchmark
12%. In view of this, the project is rated efficient.

12.      Figure A6.1 shows the accident statistics on the 180-km Surat-Manor Tollway. Serious
traffic accidents continued to occur during the construction period, but after the first section was
completed in 2003, the number of fatalities and accidents causing personal injury dropped
dramatically (fatalities by over 45%, injuries by over 46%) compared with 2002. Accidents
causing fatalities and injuries increased significantly in 2004 and 2005--fatalities by about 15%
in both 2004 and 2005, injuries by over 100% in 2004, and again by 15% in 2005. Having
separated carriageways for two-way traffic helped to reduce head-on collisions, but the wider
(four-lane) roadway results in higher speeds and causes difficulties for pedestrians wishing to
cross, who do so at some personal risk. Despite the increase in fatalities in 2004 and 2005 and
the higher levels of traffic, the number of fatalities remains below the levels experienced in 2001
and 2002 before the project.

13.      A permanent weigh-station is in operation on one section of the tollway, where the
weight of all trucks using the tollway is checked and recorded. Drivers whose load exceeds the
legal limit are fined, but are allowed to proceed back onto the tollway without first having to off-
load their excess cargo.5 Operators at the weigh-station observed that the overloaded trucks
constitute about 30% of the truck traffic. These are predominantly rigid-axle vehicles, which do
most damage to roads. The weigh-station has no equipment for off-loading cargo and no
facilities for secure storage.

14.      The evaluation team observed a lack of adequate pedestrian crossings on the highways.
Traffic control devices (traffic signals, signs, and road markings) were inconsistent and generally
insufficient to give the required advice and guidance to drivers. Although there are speed limits,
they were rarely enforced. The lack of traffic police or other enforcement agents was apparent.

                                      b.          Ongoing Projects

15.   Table A6.3 provides a summary of the ongoing ADB-supported projects, all of which
were approved since 2001.

16.     All the ongoing projects have an estimated EIRR higher than the benchmark 12% rate.
However, they face substantial implementation delays. While the EIRRs of these projects are
high, the implementation delays are likely to affect their realization at completion owing to the
rise in project costs, delayed receipt of expected benefits, and lower-than-expected traffic build-
up. Table A6.3 provides an indication of the worst-case scenarios, which are close to the
benchmark 12% rate, and in two cases lower. Because of the long implementation delays and
the resulting adverse implications for EIRRs, all ongoing projects are rated less efficient,
pending the completion and recalculation of EIRRs. This rating mainly reflects the process
efficiency, which has been poor for all projects.

    During the evaluation mission, the Indian Supreme Court passed regulations that required all transport authorities
    to enforce the legislation prohibiting the practice of overloading trucks.

                         i.       National Highways

17.     The evaluation team visited the national highway projects in Chhattisgarh that have been
or are being developed on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis, without ADB assistance. The
visits enabled a cursory field assessment of any evident operation and maintenance or safety
benefits from private sector involvement in these activities. A section of NH6 is being upgraded,
on a BOT basis, to serve as the southern entrance to Raipur. Inspection of the work site (both at
night and in the daytime) revealed the inadequacy of signs warning drivers of diversion schemes
and construction activity. Where the new, dual-carriageway has been completed (with service
roads on both sides), there was inadequate provision of safe-crossing facilities for pedestrians on
an intensively commercial section of the road. On this straight section, vehicle speeds tend to be
high, yet road signs were inadequate. On the other side of Raipur, the evaluation team visited the
Durg bypass, which was completed in 1998 and was one of the early BOT projects developed by
NHAI. The road has been maintained under the BOT contract, but the riding surface is uneven,
with signs of poor maintenance practices. The bypass also has no centerline road marking and
few traffic signs. Discussions with PWD officials indicated that although the BOT contract was
being managed by NHAI, adequate remedial action was not taken. This underlines the institutional
capacity issues faced by the NHAI.

18.     The road construction industry finds it difficult to cope with the demands placed on it by
India's extensive road improvement and network expansion program. These issues are
common across national, state, and rural road projects, whether funded by the Government,
ADB, or other development partners. The presence of international contractors has had no
value addition since these contractors do not provide sufficient managerial, technical and
financial inputs in the implementation. The World Bank-sponsored road projects in India face
problems similar to those reported for ADB projects. The industry, in general, faces the following
key problems: (i) only five or six major Indian contractors can provide the requisite services
(including staff) on BOT national highway schemes and all have full order books; (ii) qualified
112    Appendix 6



professional engineers with road construction experience in India are in short supply, and new
graduates are being attracted away from the industry by higher salaries in other fields, notably
information technology; and (iii) road projects in some states and in remote areas have staffing
problems because of commercial risks, security issues (some contractors have had equipment
destroyed), and poor living conditions. ADB's sole intervention on this subject was an advisory
technical assistance (ADTA) to study the road construction industry in 1990, with the completion
report coming out only in 2000. Although the ADTA was found to be useful, ADB must provide
more assistance to the industry in institutional strengthening and capacity building.

                      ii.     State Highways

19.     The pre-2001 ADB projects involved with state road improvements encountered some of
the same implementation problems experienced by the national highway projects. Because of
the unfamiliar contracting processes associated with ADB projects, the PWDs concerned were
reluctant to delegate responsibilities to supervision consultants. Delays were a feature of
preconstruction activities, including site clearance and the setting up of project implementation
units and their subsequent poor management of the civil works.

20.    The West Bengal Corridor Project, concerned with improving national, state, and rural
roads, was adversely affected by the poor performance of the project implementation unit in the
early period, problems with slow progress on civil works resulting in the termination of
contractors, and resettlement issues. The Government opted to withdraw a subproject from
ADB financing, since it intended to expand the scope of the subproject to widen the road and
the expansion was likely to raise involuntary resettlement issues. The decision to withdraw from
ADB financing was taken to ensure that the subproject was completed on schedule and without
the delays the executing agency thought could be associated with complying with ADB's social
safeguard policies.

21.     However, the corollary of selecting only those projects that do not involve safeguard
issues appears to be unworkable as seen in the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Project, where
there have been difficulties in identifying such "ideal" subprojects. Since 2002, ADB has provided
a combination of program and project loans to the state government of Madhya Pradesh, thus
serving the dual purpose of capacity development and capital investments. The Madhya Pradesh
project loan was aimed at rehabilitating state highways without safeguard issues. In other words,
roads that were environmentally sensitive or involved resettlement were specifically excluded from
the scope of ADB assistance. Although implementation was expected to speed up this way,
excluding environmentally sensitive projects was counterproductive to the development of an
integrated network. The executing agencies found it increasingly difficult to identify subprojects
that had no safeguard issues, such that project implementation suffered major delays. Such
incentives, which appear to be rational from the perspective of executing agencies and ADB staff,
are unlikely to be what the ADB Board had in mind when it adopted ADB's safeguard policies.

22.    The Madhya Pradesh loan included a program component that identified several policy
actions as tranche release conditions. The Madhya Pradesh Government found it difficult to
meet a key condition of the loan relating to the implementation of the staff rationalization
program, which was not completed. This required a more realistic approach based on a sound
analysis of a difficult problem that explicitly considered the views of various stakeholders. On
the whole, the design of the state roads development program could be improved by taking into
consideration the realities of each state.
                                                                                               Appendix 6      113


23.     The design of the two loans approved for state roads since 2002 tried to address the
lessons learned from the earlier projects by establishing more effective and efficient state road
sector management systems. The Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sector Development Program
(Loan 1958) has resulted in the establishment of the Madhya Pradesh Road Development
Corporation, whose responsibilities include road sector policy, resource management,
development planning, and asset management within the state and overall management of state
highways, including exploiting private sector participation opportunities. The institutional capacity
building requirements of this program are being facilitated by a TA, with cofinancing support
provided by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. The PWD of
Madhya Pradesh is the executing agency for Loan 1959, which is aimed at rehabilitating state
roads and highways in poor condition to provide reliable road transport services and support
social and economic development. The project is to rehabilitate about 1,750 km of state roads
using pre-established selection criteria relating to economic and social parameters. The civil
works contracts and resettlement plans are being administered by the Madhya Pradesh Road
Development Corporation and, by January 2006, all contracts had been awarded and four
packages were being implemented. Progress is slow, however, because of delays in mobilization
and the inefficient use of resources by contractors.

24.     The quality of detailed project reports s has been a problem across all the subsectors
including the state highways. The Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation confirmed
this and attributed the problem to the general lack of adequate skilled resources among
consultants.6 With budget constraints, the cost of detailed project report preparation has been
reduced along with the time available. This, combined with lack of adequate monitoring by the
implementing agencies, results in poor road designs and contract variations. This problem is
also common among national highway projects. In Madhya Pradesh, this problem is
compounded by the lack of experience of the implementing agencies, ultimately resulting in
poor-quality the detailed project reports. Discussions with officials indicated that it is
commonplace to find that the detailed project report estimates of project cost are lower than the
bidder's estimate or actual project cost. Similarly, traffic estimates have been found to be higher
than actual figures.

25.      Although the Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation appears to be well
organized and is developing into an efficient road management agency as envisaged by the ADB
program loan, the evaluation team noted that most of its staff are on deputation from the PWD.
This gives cause for concern about the long-term sustainability of the organization and its new
systems and procedures. The remaining PWD organization appears to be overstaffed and has (to
date) been excluded from the capacity-building activities within the TA and program.7 Another
element of concern in Madhya Pradesh is the fact that government officials see no need for a
state road fund to cover road maintenance costs because (i) the Madhya Pradesh government is
currently providing enough funds to cover the estimated cost of state-wide road maintenance
needs; and (ii) in the past 2 years, the PWD has not been able to spend the funds allocated for
road maintenance. While the lack of a state road fund appears to be a specific strategy of the
state government, it runs counter to the intent of ADB's continued involvement in this subsector,
which is to facilitate policy reforms and strengthen the PWD to improve the sustainability of the
state roads and transport agencies. A dedicated road fund would enable systematic planning and
prioritization of rehabilitation and maintenance activities in the state. While a road fund has its pros

6
    This problem has been observed for both international and domestic consultants. The turnover of the consultants'
    staff could be a factor contributing to the poor quality of outputs.
7
    This shortcoming was expected to be rectified late in 2006 when the institutional capacity building TA was to be
    extended to include the development of appropriate road management systems for the PWD in Madhya Pradesh.
114     Appendix 6



and cons, the absence of a maintenance planning tool in the Madhya Pradesh government
necessitates focused prioritization of its maintenance interventions.

26.     Site visits to state highways improvement projects found the same set of issues seen on
national highways--poor road signs, inadequate traffic signs and barriers at construction sites,
and inadequate signs at road diversion sites, particularly at bridge and culvert works.
Photographs in Appendix 14 illustrate these points. The Indian Roads Congress has developed
guidelines/standards for the industry,8 but these are ignored by contractors and supervision
consultants.

27.      The Chhattisgarh State Roads Development Sector Project9 of 2003 has many
similarities with the Madhya Pradesh Project. It is designed to support economic growth and
reduce poverty in Chhattisgarh by providing improved connectivity and access to development
opportunities and social services, including health and education. The project will finance the
improvement of 1,700 km of state roads in Chhattisgarh, to improve network connectivity, and
the improvement of priority road links between national, state, and rural roads. The goal is to
improve access for rural/underdeveloped populations to the mainstream economy and
development opportunities. There have been several start-up delays, including delays in staffing
the project implementation unit, and mobilizing the project management consultants. ADB also
provided assistance to help the project implementation unit with its start-up activities, but
removed the assistance after 6 months, thus adversely affecting the development of the new
unit. The detailed project reports for the planned roadworks have been prepared. The evaluation
team noted their variable quality, which could have negative consequences once the roadworks
start. The civil works contracts for the first phase are expected to be awarded in 2007, although
there have been delays in finalizing contracts because of poor responses from contractors
discouraged by the ongoing security situation in some rural parts of Chhattisgarh.

                          iii.     Rural Roads

28.     The Rural Roads Sector I Project10 covers Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh within the
Government's broader rural roads program (PMGSY). It is managed by the Ministry of Rural
Development and the rural road development agencies at the state level, with the latter acting as
executing agencies and project implementation units. In accordance with the basic goal of the
PMGSY program, the project is aimed at reducing poverty and deprivation in the two states by
providing better access to markets, employment opportunities, and social services to promote
economic growth. This objective is to be achieved by providing rural inhabitants with all-weather
road connections and improving safety on rural roads. The project scope includes the
reconstruction and upgrading of 5,500 km of rural roads in both Madhya Pradesh and
Chhattisgarh.

29.      There have been delays in project start-up and in the mobilization of consultants in both
Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Consultants have also reportedly changed the composition
of their teams after contract award. ADB's Integrity Division conducted an investigation into this
matter and found that three international consulting firms had changed 84­92% of their team.

Such changes in the team composition affect the implementation quality and schedules.
Although the consultants' scope of activities includes training and awareness building among
contractors and executing agencies, there has been no evidence of this. Another indicator of the
adverse impact on the quality of consultants' outputs relates to the preparation of estimates as
part of the detailed project reports. An evaluation made by the Planning Commission found that
estimates prepared under the PMGSY are on the higher side, causing underutilization of the
allocated budget.11

30.      The rural road development agency in Madhya Pradesh reported inadequate
performance by both consultants and contractors, with a lack of on-site presence by supervisory
consulting teams and of any effective training of contractors, as required by the consultants'
terms of reference. No technical ADB mission had visited the project sites to assess the work
activities. The construction sites are poorly managed in terms of traffic signs of the works and
diversions. In addition, labor issues affecting contractor staff and other disputes were recorded
as part of the evaluation socioeconomic study (Appendix 12). The evaluation team visit to
Chhattisgarh found a similar situation with overall progress even less advanced because of
issues with local contractors. Bid responses from contractors for works in remote parts of
Chhattisgarh were poor because of security reasons as well as the size of contracts (too large
for local contractors).

31.     Despite low traffic, all rural roads were being paved to flexible asphalt concrete
standards,12 calling in question the economic viability of the roads because of the high cost of
constructing paved roads. The rural roads have been over designed in terms of pavement
thickness and materials used. Besides the high cost of construction, these roads are likely to
incur high maintenance costs in the long run, prompting sustainability issues. The evaluation
team noted that the funding for rural roads could have been better used if alternative low-cost
technologies suited to rural roads had been explored.13

        2.       Railways

32.     Appendix 1 summarizes ADB-supported loans for the Indian Railways, which have followed
two main themes. In 1987­1991, ADB provided two loans to support the expansion of line and
freight haulage capacity. After a decade in which no new railway loans were approved, ADB in
2002, approved a loan centered on a program of institutional and policy reforms to improve Indian
Railways' commercial orientation,14 in parallel to its support for capital investment projects.

                 a.      Completed Projects

33.     The first rail project (Loan 857)15 included the provision of new electric freight
locomotives, supported by the transfer of technology to enable their manufacture in India,
together with the upgrading of Indian Railways' communications, signaling, workshop, and
training equipment. Because of extensive delays during implementation, project completion was
11
   A sample project evaluated by the Planning Commission showed that the amount that remained unutilized on the
   completion of these projects varied from a minimum of 6.83% to a maximum of 32.19% (Source: Quick Concurrent
   Evaluation of PMGSY, Planning Commission).
12
   The designs, approved by ADB, use concrete pavement through villages.
13
   For example, the use of sealed gravel roads is one option that could be explored for rural roads.

delayed by 5 years, with the transfer of technology component requiring a further 6 years.
Despite these delays, the 1999 project completion report rated the project "generally successful"
as Indian Railways' freight haulage capacity had been increased and the transfer of technology
had been achieved. The evaluation team validated the project completion report's findings. The
EIRR of 15% at completion was lower than the appraisal estimate (24.5%). However, since the
EIRR is above the benchmark of 12%, the project is rated efficient.

34.     The closing of the loan for the second rail project (Loan 1140),16 which included a range
of physical improvements, and the procurement of wagons and spare parts, was delayed by
3 years. The 2000 project completion report rated the project less successful because of the
poor compliance by the Indian Railways with some loan covenants, the less than full
achievement of developmental impacts, EIRRs being less than at loan appraisal, and overall
weak project management by the Indian Railways. Procurement for the project was overly
complex. The evaluation team believes that the weaknesses in project management are
attributable to the slow acceptance by the Indian Railways of ADB's procurement policies, which
were different from the Indian Railways. The Indian Railways officials, as a result, became
overly cautious in evaluating tenders and in implementing the project. Moreover, supervision by
the Indian Railways management and by ADB staff during implementation was also inadequate.
Both the completed projects were, however, able to achieve the overall objectives of improving
Indian Railways' freight haulage capacity to meet the increasing demand, albeit with long
delays. Despite the implementation issues, the project is rated efficient, since its EIRR is higher
than the benchmark 12%.

                 b.       Ongoing Project

35.      Because of the Indian Railways' continued resistance to fundamental policy reforms in the
1990s, ADB delayed further involvement in the rail subsector until a new policy reform-oriented
loan project was approved in 2002. The new project was aimed at improving the performance of
the rail subsector by supporting a program of prescribed institutional and policy reforms to develop
the commercial orientation of the Indian Railways, expansion of core businesses, finance priority
investments to overcome bottlenecks in capacity, and improve operational efficiency and safety.
These reforms are expected to strengthen the Indian Railways' accountability, transparency, and
management. This reform program was agreed on between the Indian Railways and ADB and
there appeared to be appropriate commitment, at the start, to implement it. This was supported by
the fact that the reform program was tabled before the Parliament, an unprecedented step in the
history of the Indian Railways. However, the program lost momentum for two main reasons. First,
a change in the membership of the Indian Railways board17 diluted awareness of the reforms and
enthusiasm for decision making. The turnover of ADB project officers also gave ADB staff few
opportunities for policy dialogue with the new board members. Second, in the run-up to the
national elections, there was a change in government from a coalition dominated by the Bhartiya
Janata Party to one dominated by the Congress Party. This change led to uncertainty in the
commitment of the new government to implement the reforms. However, in late 2006, consistent
with the reform agenda, the Indian Railways initiated several measures to promote the use of
private sector participation (Appendix 4).

   Technical Assistance to India for the Second Railways Project. Manila (Loan 1140-IND, for $225 million, approved
   on 5 December).
17
   As in most other public sector organizations in India, the composition of the Indian Railways board changes
   periodically. Although institutional memory is strong, the speed of decision making slows down as new incumbents
   are disinclined to take major decisions.
                                                                                         Appendix 6     117


36.     The reforms now being implemented by Indian Railways are more at the macro level--
restructuring core business activities, increasing private sector participation in container
handling, and developing a commercial orientation by decentralizing authority. These are
commendable steps. However, much remains to be done to improve decision making as part of
the organizational restructuring and to provide better services. Thus, while progress is being
achieved at the macro level, detailed reforms have yet to make headway.

37.     While structuring and implementing such reforms in a large, complex organization was
admittedly difficult, the evaluation team concluded that value-added support from ADB staff was
also lacking.18 ADB project officers changed three times in 3 years, resulting in discontinuity. In
addition, ADB project officers dealing with the Indian Railways did not have enough experience
with railway reforms. Overall, there appears to be a need to delegate supervision to the India
Resident Mission to enable more frequent dialogue with Indian Railways, which is crucial in
implementing such complex reforms. But the India Resident Mission would need to be properly
staffed and to have the required expertise for this responsibility.

38.     The implementation of the capital investment component of the project has been
delayed significantly and disbursements have been slow.19 A series of difficulties have been
experienced in the procurement for civil works associated with rail system upgrades and the
implementation of the specified policy reforms. Inadequate supervision by ADB staff adversely
affected the capital investment component. For example, four issues could have been resolved
with more effective supervision. First, ADB's procurement policy required detailed technical
specifications including detailed costing; the unfamiliarity of the Indian Railways staff with these
led to several delays. Second, the large integrated contracts that ADB required the Indian
Railways to award drew a poor response from contractors and the apparent raising of
prequalification criteria did not help matters. Third, there appears to be a distinct gap between
ADB's involuntary resettlement policy and the country's national policy and laws, particularly
with regard to replacement value and indigenous people. This gap has been further widened by
the inability of ADB and Indian Railways to arrive at a mutually acceptable procedure and output
for a resettlement plan, prompting the Indian Railways to withdraw an "urgent" project from ADB
assistance. Fourth, the approval of reports by ADB was delayed in several instances. In one
such instance, ADB took 8 months to approve a social report. The evaluation team noted that
the first two issues have since been resolved, and progress is being made on the other two.
This experience underlines the point that ADB must adopt a more flexible approach to
implementing projects, rather than a standard approach for all countries.

        2.      Sources of Implementation Delays

39.     A typical road project implementation schedule is in Figure A6.2. A comparison of this
typical schedule with the actual implementation schedules identified several bottlenecks that
appear to be common across projects.

40.     The prime sources for the delays have been:
        (i)    Project preparation and administration
               (a)     inadequate or inaccurate project preparation, especially the detailed
                       project reports;

18
   The reform program is supported by an ADB TA, which provides management consulting services to the Indian
   Railways to monitor policy reforms and advice on business opportunities (Appendix 8).
19
   The project was approved in December 2002. By 31 December 2005, only 0.5% of the total loan had been
   disbursed, and by 31 August 2006, only 13%. By 31 December 2006, as against an elapsed loan period of 73%,
   the project progress was just 10%.
118    Appendix 6



               (b)    inadequate technical resources in executing agencies and implementing
                      agencies;
               (c)    land acquisition and removal of encumbrances from the right-of-way;
               (d)    delays in the preparation and approval of resettlement plans;
               (e)    unclear environmental assessments and lack of familiarity with the
                      requirements of environmental safeguards; and
               (f)    lack of procurement planning.
       (ii)    Contractors' performance
               (a)    insufficient or inadequately experienced engineering staff of the
                      consultant or contractor, resulting in poor performance by the
                      overstretched supervision consultant or contractor;
               (b)    poor mobilization of equipment; and
               (c)    cash-flow problems of contractors due to low bid prices.

       3.      Project Preparation and Administration

41.     The executing agencies across all the subsectors expressed concerns with the poor
quality of the detailed project report preparation, which causes implementation delays. The cost
of preparing a detailed project report, as well as the time available to prepare it, has been
reduced over the years. This, combined with poor monitoring of the detailed project report
process by the executing agency, results in inaccuracies in the detailed project reports and large
contract variations. On the consultants' side, detailed project report preparation is perceived to
be less lucrative than project supervision.

42.     On the executing agencies' side, the staff have inadequate experience with the detailed
project report process. The fact that most of the staff are on deputation also contributes to this
problem. In the case of the NHAI, this is an important issue. NHAI staff have changed after
project preparation. The inclination is to complete the immediate formalities of getting
clearances for the project and the preparation of bid documents, rather than to verify the
accuracy and quality of the detailed project report. Moreover, owing to the disparity in the
procedures and requirements relating to environmental and social safeguards among the
development partners, there remains a high degree of unfamiliarity within the executing
agencies and implementing agencies about the implementation of these safeguards. In addition,
the completed projects (e.g., Loan 1041) showed inadequate contract administration because of:
        (i)     deficiencies in project management setup;
        (ii)    lack of properly planning of works at the site;
        (iii)   lack of appropriate financial management;
        (iv)    insufficient resource mobilization by the contractor; and
        (v)     lack of respect for contractual agreements.

43.  Some of these issues have been mitigated. In the case of the NHAI, financial
management has been streamlined, with better monitoring of project cash flows.

44.    Acquisition of land is another major source of delay. Inadequate land records result in
delays in finalizing compensation. This is aggravated by litigations initiated by aggrieved
persons affected by the land acquisition. With the slow judicial system, the resolution of these
cases causes delays.

45.    The land acquisition problems are further accentuated by delays in the preparation and
approval of resettlement plans. In the case of the Rural Roads Sector I Project, unfamiliarity with
                                                                                                       Appendix 6        119


ADB's procedures caused delays in the submission of resettlement plans by the executing
agencies. Coupled with this is the systemic issue of delays within ADB due to the time taken to
approve these plans by the various departments at ADB headquarters. There has been a move to
delegate this responsibility to the India Resident Mission, but the transfer has not yet been made.

46.     Complying with the environment safeguard for road projects is seen as basically fulfilling
conditions of the Ministry of Environment and Forest and ADB or the World Bank rather than
understanding the environmental issues.20 As a result, project clearances take longer. Quite often
this is caused by a lack of familiarity with the requirements. Making better use of consultants,
developing and training government staff, and harmonizing ADB's and the World Bank's
requirements with the laws and guidelines of the central and state governments could help in
resolving this issue.

47.         Procurement delays continue for various reasons:
            (i)    Lack of procurement planning, although in the case of NHAI this has been
                   remedied;
            (ii)   Delays in contract award caused by unfamiliarity with ADB's procedures and
                   insufficient delegation of authority;
            (iii)  Inappropriate contractor packaging; and
            (iv)   Poor assessment of contractors' capability during prequalification, resulting in
                   delays in the later stages of procurement or in the implementation of the project.

            4.       Contractors' Performance

48.    In almost every project, delays are caused by poor planning, cash-flow issues, poor site
management, management issues with joint venture partners, insufficient equipment, etc.,
among the civil works contractors. These problems could be attributed to the lack of experience
among the contractors. The supervision consultants have had similar problems relating to
inexperience, resulting in poor road designs and inadequate supervision.

49.     With the current boom in road construction, consultants tend to work on several projects at
the same time and cannot deploy adequately skilled persons in time. During the project proposal
stage, these consultants present their most experienced personnel to win the consultancy contract,
but then replace them during implementation. Because of the general shortage of skilled
manpower, both consultants and contractors find it difficult to field an adequate team.

50.    The Government has encouraged joint ventures between international and domestic
contractors for large packages to bring in better technology and at the same time build up the
domestic contracting industry. But such joint ventures have not benefited the industry. Weak

20
     Mandatory Ministry of Environment and Forest questionnaires give more emphasis to collecting a wide range of
     background data. This requirement is not oriented to identifying and prioritizing the environmental issues arising from
     the project activities. Rarely are issues prioritized to lend focus as well as cost-effectiveness to the environmental
     assessment. The lack of adequate prioritization of environmental issues is seen in the unclear summary initial
     environmental examination for the NHDP II Project, which has potentially serious significant environmental impact.
     The lack of clarity relating to details of assessment regarding the type, magnitude, and location of possible adverse
     impact is apparent. In particular, the summary initial environmental examination consists of mostly generic statements
     on type of impact (e.g., noise, dust, construction wastes) and the mitigating methods but fails to highlight the specific
     key issues that may face each particular segment of the road subprojects or the issues relating to wildlife sanctuaries
     and the potential secondary impact of construction activity on the animals. In the case of the Madhya Pradesh State
     Roads Project, as with many other road projects, the main environmental impacts may occur offsite, depending on
     where and how the construction materials are excavated and wastes disposed of. Neither the summary initial
     environmental examination nor site interviews could provide answers to the questions on these issues.
120    Appendix 6



joint ventures between the contracting partners have resulted in disputes leading to project
delays as seen in the Western Transport Corridor project. There have been occasions when
international contractors have lent their name to secure a particular contract, but most of the
work was done by the domestic contractor. So most of the highway construction work is now
being done by Indian firms, many of which did not exist 10 years ago and until recently had no
specific roads highway experience.

C.     Recommendations for Resolving Implementation Issues

51.    Given below is a list of recommendations that ADB could adopt to resolve the above
implementation issues. Although not exhaustive, this list suggests resolution of the key
bottlenecks through a dialogue between ADB and the Government.

       1.     Project Preparation and Administration

52.    To address project preparation and administration issues, ADB and the Government
could:
       (i)    Establish project implementation units as a condition of Board presentation and
              ensure that these units are trained before procurement starts.
       (ii)   Screen projects for readiness to avoid premature Board presentation.
       (iii)  Improve quality at entry, i.e., address some of the issues identified in the
              evaluation.
       (iv)   Make more frequent use of advance consultant recruitment and procurement
              action and retroactive financing.
       (v)    Make more realistic implementation schedules, using more rigorous appraisal
              tools at project preparatory TA stage.
       (vi)   Ensure adequate resources for project implementation in the transport sector in
              both the Transport and Communications Division of the South Asia Department
              and the India Resident Mission.
       (vii)  Delegate approval powers to the India Resident Mission to hasten the approval
              of environmental and social safeguards.
       (viii) Harmonize ADB and World Bank procedures for implementing safeguards with
              the laws and guidelines of the central and state governments.
       (ix)   Sustain and improve the current practice of country portfolio review missions to
              ensure dialogue with the Government of India in addressing systemic and project
              implementation issues.
       (x)    Continue and improve the current practice of encouraging new executing
              agencies to learn from the experience of executing agencies from past projects.
              The Ministry of Finance and the Planning Commission could encourage an
              annual meeting of executing agencies and ADB staff could offer training related
              to consultant recruitment, procurement, disbursement, and project administration.

       2.     Contractors' Performance

53.    To address contractors' issues, ADB and the Government could:
       (i)   Draw on the findings of the recent World Bank study to develop a plan of action
             in conjunction with the Government that will help to build capacities within the
             contractors and consultants. For example, the encouragement given by the
             Government to joint ventures is a step in the right direction.
       (ii)  Package contracts in sizes that will be easier for contractors to implement.

122    Appendix 7



                    STRATEGIC POSITIONING IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR

1.      The Asian Development Bank's (ADB's) strategy in the last 3 years was focused on the
following main components and related activities:

       1.      Physical Investments

2.     Physical development was guided by the following considerations:
       (i)    Emphasis on existing infrastructure and facilities, with priority placed on
              upgrading the capacity and efficiency of existing infrastructure, and limited new
              investments to supplement the existing network to realize new economic
              opportunities and enhance the overall efficiency of transport systems. While no
              new roads were built, existing roads were rehabilitated (as shown in Map 1).
       (ii)   Establishment of total connectivity to provide rural communities with
              connections to urban centers, enable farmers to access more profitable markets
              and rural communities to participate in mainstream society, and provide better
              transport connections between urban centers to form a nationwide transport
              network.
       (iii)  Development of a modally balanced transport system, by moderating the
              trend toward dependence on road-based transport in favor of a more sustainable
              transport mix integrating more environmentally friendly modes such as railways
              and inland waterways transport.
       (iv)   Contribution to reducing disparities between states, by selectively expanding
              ADB's operations from its focal states (Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh) to
              include other states, particularly northeastern states and other reform-oriented
              states, to help reduce regional income disparities.
       (v)    Contribution to subregional economic cooperation, by supporting transport
              projects that would have positive impact on subregional trade.

       2.      Policy and Institutional Reforms

3.     Policy and institutional reforms were provided in a progressive and evolving manner on
the basis of agreed medium- and long-term goals, and with emphasis on national ownership of
reform processes. Issues to be pursued through policy dialogue included:
       (i)     Separation of policy and operational functions to establish separate
               responsibility for regulatory and operational functions of government transport
               agencies (e.g., Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways, state public
               works departments, Ministry of Railways, and port authorities) to ensure clear
               accountability for the results of program implementation.
       (ii)    Sources of investment funding required to upgrade transport systems, a
               central issue being the identification and securitization of necessary investment
               financing for the National Highway Development Program (NHDP), to develop
               the inland waterways transport system, and to increase internal revenue
               generation by operating railways commercially, rationalizing freight and
               passenger tariffs, discontinuing unprofitable activities, and establishing a public
               service obligation mechanism for the Government to meet the cost of any
               uneconomic services it wishes Indian Railways to provide for social reasons.
       (iii)   Operation and maintenance systems to be established to ensure that newly
               created assets are appropriately maintained, and their right-of-way kept clear.
               For national highways, operation and maintenance activities are being
               progressively transferred to the private sector while, at the state level, the
                                                                                 Appendix 7    123


               maintenance activities traditionally carried out by public works departments need
               to be improved. For rural roads, ADB planned to help rural road authorities
               introduce sustainable maintenance mechanisms.
       (iv)    Increased private sector participation to facilitate the shift in infrastructure
               development financing from the public sector to the private sector as the
               economy grows, by establishing a policy environment conducive to the
               expansion of infrastructure and services. Support was to be provided to facilitate
               the securitization of future revenue flows derived from toll road operations and,
               for state and rural roads, more engineering and civil works were to be contracted
               out. Private sector participation in the ports subsector was to be monitored
               closely to assess the need for improvements, while private sector participation
               prospects as part of Indian Railways reforms were to be considered, including
               private concessions for operating loss-making branch lines, competition in rail
               container services, and private sector provision of freight terminal services.
               Private sector participation in the inland waterways transport was to be
               encouraged by the identification of commercially viable projects as an
               essential first step forward.
       (v)     Transport safety, aimed at addressing the significant increases in road traffic
               accidents as the network has improved, by means of studies into the introduction
               of highway patrols and emergency medical services, and the preparation of a
               dangerous-goods transport emergency plan. Community-level road safety
               initiatives were included with rural road improvements and ADB planned overall
               approaches to improving road safety in cooperation with other multilateral and
               bilateral aid agencies. For the railway subsector, accidents have also become an
               area of concern. Safety improvements, by replacing and upgrading depleted
               assets on congested routes, were to be included in ADB support for railways. For
               inland waterways transport, the incidence of traffic accidents is also believed to
               be high, but accident data are lacking, and most accidents are believed to involve
               passenger traffic. ADB plans to address these problems by providing support to
               strengthen inland waterways transport traffic accident data collection systems.

A.     Maintaining System Balance and Meeting Capacity Requirements

4.      The mobility and flexibility that roads offer, coupled with the substantial increase in the
supply of road infrastructure in many parts of India, has led to a big change in the mode share in
freight toward road and away from rail. Coastal shipping and pipelines have also become
significant modes, primarily at the cost of the rail share. This has implications for road
infrastructure investments, in terms of capacity and quality of roads, over and above access
considerations. In the road subsector, because of the increases in motorized transport, larger
cars, and vehicles with more features like air-conditioning, the energy intensity has been
increasing. Conversely, the energy intensity in the rail subsector has been decreasing with the
introduction of more efficient locomotives.

5.      Largely as a result of growing export-import trade, containerized movement in India--
using both rail and road transport services--is increasing. However, the supply side in terms of
ports with appropriate services, hinterland connectivity, and infrastructure for domestic
movements is significantly below the potential. The overall demographic and sociological forces
in the country have also led to a larger fraction of the population moving to urban areas. This
has resulted in a need for increased attention to the requirements of passengers and freight,
apart from specific urban transportation needs, including an efficient interface between inter-
and intra-urban transport systems.
124     Appendix 7




6.      Rather than infrastructure provisioning by the public sector being taken for granted, it
has now come to be accepted that the user should pay for the use of good-quality infrastructure.
This has enabled a commercial orientation to infrastructure development in India, either entirely
by government or through public-private partnerships. While the former has implications for
financing and pricing, the latter also has the advantage of leveraging private entrepreneurship.

7.      Over the past 20 years, ADB and other financing agencies, mainly the World Bank and
Japan Bank for International Cooperation, have supported many projects to address the
mismatches between demand for and supply of transport services in India. Most ADB projects
(primarily involving capacity constraints on India's roads, rail, and ports systems) have been
successfully accomplished. To date, India has been able to channel sufficient funding from
government budgetary support (from fuel cess and toll collections), the private sector (through
private sector participation), or external agencies to finance NHDP I and II. For all later phases
of the NHDP, the Government envisages all roadworks to be primarily on a build-operate-
transfer basis with government budgetary support only where there is a viability gap; i.e., for
those road sections not considered economically viable and where private sector interest is not
forthcoming. The evaluation team noted also that several national highway sections in some
states (notably Bihar, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Assam) have been released by the National
Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for upgrading on a build-operate-transfer basis under the
NHDP, but have met with little response from bidders because of security issues in these
locations. For non-NHDP highways and the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana program for
rural roads, the Government intends to provide finance from its own revenue sources.

8.      In line with the overarching development goals, the development partners including ADB
have been considering support for those transport projects that are socially and developmentally
desirable yet financially unviable and for which there are gaps in funding. This would appear to
suggest a more selective approach to national highway and state highway improvements, with
more focus given to the development of all-weather rural roads and other transport projects
(e.g., capital dredging to deepen port access channels, infrastructure improvements to catalyze
waterways development) having little appeal for private investors, but potentially advantageous
in achieving overall system balance or social objectives.

9.       In the port subsector, ADB's assistance ceased in the late 1990s, by which time the
private sector was actively engaged in several of India's major ports and ADB had made a
positive contribution to this development. However, there are now signs that the ports are under
increasing pressure as a result of India's growing economy and trade. Some aspects of the ports
(e.g., insufficient draft to permit large vessels to use the major ports) require attention but there is
limited interest from private investors. With both the national highway and rail networks being
connected to the major ports as part of the NHDP and National Rail Vikas Yojana programs, and
with dedicated rail freight corridors being developed for container services to and from the major
ports, the evaluation team noted that the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways has
an interest in ADB reassessing its earlier decision to withdraw from the port subsector.

B.      Strategic Positioning

       1.      National Highways

10.    The common objectives of ADB's lending program for national highways are to help
remove capacity constraints, enhance road safety, promote public-private partnership, and
increase the managerial capabilities of NHAI and provincial executing agencies. While these
                                                                                 Appendix 7    125


objectives in themselves are significant, the effectiveness of lending programs could be reduced
by the multiplicity of objectives.

11.     A positive aspect of the projects' scope for lending is that a "corridor" approach has been
taken. In fact, as the transition is made from engineering, procurement, construction contracts to
a BOT framework, longer segments would naturally be in order.

12.     Safety needs to be given high priority, since the removal of capacity constraints has in
principle been accepted, through a four-lane construction program. Improved safety requires
focusing on engineering design and on roadside furniture and signs, and quick recovery in case
of accidents. With the improvement in the quality of roads, India is moving into a category of
higher vehicular speeds that needs to be balanced by a corresponding improvement in road
safety. Independent programs and projects that focus on vehicular and driver (licensing)
aspects of safety should be considered.

13.     Independent programs for the managerial capacity enhancement of NHAI and state
public works departments need a strong focus. NHAI suffers from not having its own cadre
since it is staffed largely on deputation, and without necessarily having a commercial focus. On
the other hand, state Public Works Department engineers may be more inward looking, without
a significant commercial perspective.

14.     Making the state public works departments separate companies to compete at the
national level would energize them. NHAI and public works departments need greater focus
(and fundamental capabilities) on the environment, land acquisition, resettlement and
rehabilitation, legal issues, and concession management.

15.   Capacity building in the private sector (contractors and consultants) and the road
equipment manufacturing sector are high priorities.

       2.      State Highways

16.    The primary focus in state highways subsector should be on (i) maintenance for state
roads, and (ii) all-weather connectivity and maintenance for rural roads. Outsourcing
maintenance to private players should be the objective. Local community oversight should be
leveraged in the case of rural roads, both for project selection and for maintenance.

       3.      Railways

17.    New corridors focused on better connectivity (missing links) would be a priority.
Enhancement of capacity in bottleneck corridors through soft investments (signaling and
information technology) would be the next.

18.     ADB's earlier support in setting up the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited was a step in the right
direction for the creation of an appropriate institutional framework and institution for catalyzing
key rail projects. Issues may remain in the selection of joint venture partners, equity share
holding, management control, revenue and cost sharing, guarantees, etc.
126    Appendix 7




       4.      Technical Assistance

19.    Capacity building to support the transition to commercially autonomous institutional
frameworks should be the priority in the context of NHAI, state public works departments,
railways, and ports.

20.     Reform programs are a good approach, though they sometimes lack clarity and
specificity (e.g., in the case of the technical assistance for the Indian Railways). However, there
may have to be a balance between over determining a reform and providing space for the
organization to discover its own direction, especially during transitional phases.

                         ASSESSMENT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

A.     Basis of Assessment

1.      Among the multilateral and bilateral development agencies, the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) is the largest provider of technical assistance (TA) to India's transport sector.
Between 1987 and 2005, ADB has provided 19 advisory TA projects. Of these, 15 have been
completed (closed), with majority (11) of these having been approved before 1995. In other
words, most of the TA projects were completed a long time back. This has implications for the
availability of information and evidence for assessing the success of this assistance. Owing to
the lack of adequate information, the evaluation team has had to rely on TA completion reports,
which have been validated on the basis of general impacts seen in the sector. Ongoing TA
projects have been evaluated on the basis of discussions with current officials of the executing
agencies with limited institutional memory. Moreover, with the ongoing TA projects, the
outcomes can be seen only after they are completed. The assessment herein is an indication of
the likely success of these TA projects.

2.        The advisory TA projects can be clustered into five groups: (i) systems planning,
(ii) institutional capacity building, (iii) private sector participation, (iv) policy development, and
(v) safety. These are the basic themes targeted by the ADB TA. These TA projects have usually
been approved as part of a loan project, although the implementation has been separate in terms
of procurement of consultants and generation of outputs. Table A8.1 provides an assessment for
each TA.

          1.      Technical Assistance Projects Related to Transport Systems Planning

3.     This group comprised seven TA projects, four in the roads subsector and three in the
railways subsector. In all cases, the general aim has been to introduce new systems to improve
management capabilities, operational efficiencies, and capacity.

4.       TA 10581 was designed to provide assistance in preparing a pavement management
system in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The TA completion report noted that decisions for
maintaining roads in both states continued to be made on standard norms, with no
institutionalization or ownership of pavement management system. As a result, the results of the
TA were not incorporated into the operations of the road agencies, reducing the effectiveness of
the TA. Moreover, since the TA did not have any follow-up actions, it lacked sustainability. Overall,
the TA has been unsuccessful.

5.      TA 10592 was designed to provide assistance to the Ministry of Surface Transport in
establishing a system to aid decision making in improving national highway traffic corridors,
including the means to assess the financial viability of options. The TA completion report noted
that the TA outcome was a "study" rather than a "system," which examined the means of
verifying the need for controlled-access facilities, grade-separated interchanges, and private
sector participation. There is not enough information about this TA. However, since the
development of expressways made little progress in later years, this study has been less useful
to the Ministry of Surface Transport and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). In
addition, the private sector participation mechanisms now being developed are a result of the
later TA projects. Overall, the TA is rated less successful.

6.      TA 14023 was aimed at developing a pavement management system for national
highways. Assistance was provided to the Ministry of Surface Transport in developing a
computer-based pavement management system for national highways, and to Karnataka and
Uttar Pradesh in implementing the system on a pilot basis, supported by staff training by the
Ministry of Surface Transport and the Public Works Department (PWD). The TA completion
report rated the TA unsuccessful as a result of a lack of ownership or involvement of the
Ministry of Surface Transport and the PWDs in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. No pavement
management system was installed or in use. This lack of uptake indicates the need to update
road maintenance practices and standards, and to undertake an institutional development study
to make a "pavement management system approach" effective at the Ministry of Surface
Transport and in the PWDs. Overall, the TA is rated unsuccessful.

7.      TA 46974 will provide assistance to facilitate the long-term preservation of road assets in
the northeastern states. The TA will develop the capacity of the northeastern states' PWDs
through (i) computer-based road asset management tools; and (ii) the use of state-of-the-art
project management techniques, thereby improving the quality of the roads and increasing the

productivity of labor and capital during and after the ensuing loan project is implemented. This
TA is likely to be successful.

8.       For the railway subsector, TA 16205 was a three-part TA to improve existing systems:
(i) to develop a computer-aided design for a maintenance-free overhead electrical system, (ii) to
identify mitigating factors causing capacity constraints in two major railway corridors, and (iii) to
examine ways and means to conserve energy in lubricating oils for locomotives. The 2000 loan
project completion report reported that the TA was implemented as envisaged at appraisal and
that its recommendations were largely implemented. Overhead electrical systems development
was assisted by improvements in resources available for training, the establishment of training
standards, the adoption of new equipment for measuring the running performance, and the
introduction of more eight-wheeler tower wagons for efficient damage recovery. Capacity
constraints were identified and addressed using mechanized track maintenance on a wider
basis, and improved train planning procedures, enforcement of maintenance standards, and
quality and inspection procedures for maintenance and repair work. Energy conservation was
achieved using alternatives to lubricating oil in the context of overall operating budget and
policy, and by developing a fuel efficiency kit to be fitted to locomotives. Overall, this TA is rated
highly successful.

9.      TA 16216 assisted with the handling of non-bulk freight traffic on the railway. The project
completion report for Loan 1140 reported that the Indian Railways incorporated several of the
recommendations from this TA into its operations. The Indian Railways (i) replaced the speed
link and other similar services with mechanized trains by adding suitable vans, ventilated
wagons, etc., in phases; (ii) privatized parcel services to introduce competition; and (iii) closed
parcel and perishable station sheds after 2 years of unprofitable operation. The Indian Railways
continued to implement other recommendations from the TA gradually. Overall, this TA is rated
highly successful.

10.     TA 16227 provided assistance to the Indian Railways in traffic costing and financial
management systems. The project completion report for Loan 1140 reported that the Indian
Railways had not implemented the TA recommendations. The TA recommended activity-based
costing and a revised format for financial reporting. The Indian Railways stated that the
recommended system was not practical for Indian Railways to implement. In 1996, however,
Indian Railways developed the activity-based unit costing system by itself to transform the
operating divisions of Indian Railways into centers of financial performance. Since then, through
policy dialogue for the ensuing (2002) ADB project, Indian Railways has agreed to implement
the new costing system on a pilot basis. This TA is found to be less successful. However, the
evaluation team noted that the Indian Railways has recently resumed efforts to improve its
accounting system as part of the reform agenda agreed on with ADB.

B.        Technical Assistance Projects for Institutional Capacity Building

11.   This group comprised six TA projects in the road subsector. In all cases, the aim of the
TA was to provide the means to strengthen the nodal transport authority.

12.     TA 14048 was aimed at a comprehensive study of the road construction industry,
including analysis of the institutional and business environment, and recommendations to
address current impediments, stimulate growth, increase competence, and raise the
professional standing of the industry. The rationale behind the TA was to identify the causes of
deteriorating quality of works, time and cost overruns in projects, and the inability of the industry
to cope with road projects under the 8th Five-Year Plan. The 2000 TA completion report rated
the TA generally successful. The TA identified weaknesses caused by the lack of exposure of
the local industry to international practices, the need for training (all levels), and the need to
streamline administrative and procedural policies. The TA completion report reported that the
results of the TA were being used by the Ministry of Surface Transport and ADB including a
recommendation in Loan 1274 to increase the exposure of the local construction industry to
international practices. The TA completion report recommended that ADB continue a policy
dialogue with the Ministry of Surface Transport/NHAI on ways to boost the Indian road
construction industry, although it remains to be seen whether this issue can be resolved through
policy interventions or through the gradual maturity of the industry. Overall, this TA is rated
successful.

13.     The National Highways Project (Loan 1274)9 included two TA projects in institutional
capacity building: (i) TA 2002,10 which developed environmental standards for road projects;
and (ii) TA 2003,11 which was aimed at developing and implementing improved standards for
concrete structures. TA 2002 was focused on strengthening the Ministry of Surface Transport
and PWDs to enable them to carry out environmental assessments of road projects and to
ensure that road projects complied with the regulations of ADB and the Government of India.
The TA was to prepare environmental guidelines for roads in India, provide training to the
Ministry of Surface Transport/PWD staff in environmental impact assessments and
environmental management of road projects, and prepare manuals on the guidelines for
contractors. A 1999 Operations Evaluation Department (OED) evaluation of the TA projects
after completion determined that TA 2002 had a "quite high" impact on the environmental
standards being adopted in India for road works. Overall, TA 2002 is rated successful.

14.    TA 2003 was aimed at developing, obtaining approval for, and implementing better
standards for concrete structures. The 1999 OED evaluation found that the Ministry of Surface
Transport and the Indian Roads Congress were "not very proactive" in promoting the
recommendations for improved standards for concrete structures. Overall, this TA is rated less
successful.

15.      TA 336112 was aimed at increasing the efficiency of implementing civil works contracts
on major road projects by (i) improving NHAI contract supervision and management in line with
internationally applied procedures, (ii) enhancing the responsibilities and accountability of an
independent engineer, (iii) promoting a change in attitude to allow for a fair partnership,
(iv) incorporating lessons learned into pre-contract and contract management activities, and

(v) enhancing NHAI capacities in contract management. The 2003 TA completion report rated
the TA successful and noted that it had dealt with the serious issues in contract management in
NHAI and had achieved all the TA objectives, and identified further actions to be taken by the
Government and NHAI. Furthermore, the TA served to improve NHAI capacity in contract
management. Project implementation substantially improved and, as a result, ADB has provided
three highway projects to India since 2000 with NHAI as the executing agency.

16.     The TA enabled eight courses of training in contract management for NHAI staff,
contractors, and local consultants over 15 days, focused on improving understanding of the
International Federation of Consulting Engineers (Fédération Internationale des Ingénieurs
Conseils) procedures. Although there was a general appreciation of the content of these
courses, the length of this training appears to be short. In addition, this training needs to be
done more regularly to cover more staff members. The design of such training courses needs to
be discussed with NHAI during TA fact-finding, especially since NHAI needs to be sufficiently
equipped to ensure continuity of this training and use of the content. Although the capability of
NHAI has improved, its performance needs to be monitored and training continued. Overall, the
TA 3361 is rated highly successful.

17.     As part of Loan 1944,13 the ongoing TA 372414 has a range of capacity-building
objectives under two modules. Draft final reports on Module I (1, 2, and 3) and Module II (3)
were submitted in May 2006. The objectives of the TA are as follows:
        (i)   Module I: Capacity Building for fund mobilization and financial management
              (a)    Support for fund mobilization;
              (b)    Support for improvements in the treasury function; and
              (c)    Support for improvements in the financial reporting system.
        (ii)  Module II: Enhancement of NHAI's capability to handle emerging social and
              operational issues
              (a)    Monitoring of relocation and resettlement activities and grievance
                     handling;
              (b)    Road safety module; and
              (c)    Integrated operation and maintenance scheme.

18.     There has been a major improvement in NHAI's capability to mobilize private sector
funding for small, as well as large projects. In parallel, NHAI's capacity to handle environmental
and social issues has improved, although it still has a long way to go. Overall, the TA's
objectives are likely to be achieved. The TA is rated likely to be successful.

19.     The ongoing TA 4013 and its supplementary TA15 are aimed at providing assistance in
establishing a state-owned corporation in Madhya Pradesh to manage the state highway
network. While this has been generally achieved, one of the components--reducing PWD
staff--was not achieved. However, this component is seen to be impractical given the wider
impact of reducing staff, which requires more time and effort. The supplementary TA was
intended to assist with strengthening the Madhya Pradesh PWD in the management of Madhya

Pradesh's remaining road network. Substantial progress has been made in setting up
institutional arrangements and developing systems for the implementation of the road
improvement program under ADB Loan 195916 to improve the state highways network. While
the newly set up Madhya Pradesh State Road Development Corporation is perceived to be well
resourced and capable of managing the state highways network with private sector assistance,
the PWD continues to lag behind in terms of capacity and systems. Overall, the TA has been
successful, but on the lower side.

C.      Technical Assistance Grants Related to Private Sector Participation

20.     This group comprised three TA projects--two involving private sector participation
development for the national highways, and one for a multimodal corridor. In all cases, the aim
of the TA projects was to provide the enabling environment to encourage private sector
participation.

21.     TA 1403 was aimed at establishing the feasibility of promoting private sector
participation in financing, constructing and operating expressways, and assisting the Ministry of
Surface Transport in developing policies to attract private sector investments. The TA
completion report rated the TA generally successful, as it provided a model for increased
awareness in the Ministry of Surface Transport of build-operate-transfer arrangements,
including parameters to attract private sector interest. The TA recommendations were used in
developing the Government's Guidelines for Private Investment in national highways. The TA
also identified the need to set up an apex body to manage expressway development (i.e., NHAI),
and this recommendation was subsequently implemented. Overall, this TA is rated highly
successful.

22.     TA 344517 provided assistance to the government of West Bengal in multimodal corridor
development. Its aim was to establish the institutional prerequisites for building a relationship
based on trust between the public and private sectors for the overall purpose of developing the
economic corridor. This was necessary to ensure that sufficient high-level project management
skills would be in place from 2000 onward to oversee and expedite all aspects of the investment
implementation process. However, little information is available on the uptake of this TA. Overall,
the TA is rated successful.

23.     An ongoing TA 427118 is aimed at facilitating the implementation of the High Density
Corridor Program by (i) establishing institutional arrangements necessary for project
management and financing mechanisms, and (ii) elaborating the concept of the entire program
to provide an overall plan for its implementation. The TA has five components:
        (i)    Institutional arrangements;
        (ii)   Traffic projection and prioritization;
        (iii)  Public-private partnership investment schemes;
        (iv)   Program design; and
        (v)    Social safeguards.

24.    This TA appears to cover many areas and lacks focus. While the NHAI has been
progressing well on these fronts, it is difficult to attribute the progress to a broad TA program.
The evaluation team did not find specific evidence linking this TA with the general progress
being made by NHAI. Overall, this TA is likely to be less successful.

D.      Technical Assistance Grants Related to Policy Development

25.    This group comprised two TA projects for the railway subsector. In both cases, the aim
of the TA projects was to provide assistance with policies and policy reforms to improve the
management of the railway subsector.

26.     TA 272119 provided assistance to the Government in formulating a program for
improving the efficiency and performance of the railway subsector. The TA defined key policy
actions and investment components that were considered critical for the sustainable
improvement of Indian Railways' efficiency, capacity, safety, and competitiveness. The TA drew
attention to the need to restore Indian Railways' financial sustainability, and proposed options
for improvement, including increasing Indian Railways' commercial orientation, reducing costs,
strengthening governance, rationalizing tariffs, promoting private sector participation,
strengthening financial systems, and providing training. No TA completion report was prepared.
This TA led to Loan 1981, which contains a broad reform agenda for Indian Railways as well as
a capital investment component. Overall, the TA is rated successful.

27.      The ongoing TA 405320 is aimed at improving the performance of the railway sector by
supporting (i) the implementation of a program of institutional and policy reforms to improve the
Indian Railways' commercial orientation, and (ii) the expansion of core businesses by financing
priority investments to overcome railway capacity bottlenecks and improve operational efficiency
and safety. The project is also intended to contribute to organizational efficiency by promoting
outsourcing, award of concessions, and use of consolidated contracts for the execution of
railway investment projects. This TA has been less than successful so far, however, owing to its
limited scope of monitoring the progress of the reforms. Since the reform agenda is rather broad,
there is little scope for the TA to add value in identifying specific tasks to implement the reforms.
In addition, since the TA is basically managed by ex-Indian Railways officers, its effectiveness is
reduced by a direct conflict of interest. Although the TA is likely to adequately monitor the
progress of reforms, it remains to be seen how it will add value to the reform process. Overall,
the TA is likely to be less successful.

E.      Technical Assistance Projects Related to Safety

28.    This group comprised just one TA for roads and highways. The aim of the TA was to
provide assistance with some aspects of the industry that had an overall effect on the specific
subsector.

29.     The National Highways Project (Loan 1274) included TA 2001,21 which was aimed at
assisting the Government in improving the knowledge, capability, and training of personnel
(particularly the Ministry of Surface Transport and relevant state agencies) in accident analysis,

traffic engineering, and the design of low-cost road accident countermeasures. An ADB project
performance audit report evaluated this TA in conjunction with other ADB TA projects in road
safety (in the People's Republic of China, Philippines, etc.), and the evaluation team noted that
it was "relevant to immediate/short-term priorities," but also that the international consultants
could have been more effective in disseminating ADB's Guidelines for Road Safety, besides
giving workshops on these. The evaluation team also noted the insufficiency of the 8 person-
months for international consultants in the TA. One case study (Karnataka) was undertaken, but
the results were not disseminated. Institutional capacity building had limited impact, and only for
the Karnataka police, who achieved an accident database for NH4 and NH7. However, because
of time and resource constraints, other TA objectives were not fully achieved, as the TA was not
successful in assisting domestic consultants in identifying road black-spots. A highway safety
manual was prepared and distributed, but with little impact, since the safety of the national
highways has not improved. The evaluation team noted that TA 2001 had minimal impact on the
subsequent Loan 1274, although it made a number of specific recommendations for follow-up,
on which the rating of Loan 1274 was to be contingent. ADB review missions during the
implementation of the TA reported that the TA could not successfully achieve all its objectives
since NHAI was not proactive in implementing its recommendations. Overall, the road safety TA
is rated less successful.

30.       Road safety is a major problem and needs to be better supported. Since this TA, ADB
has included a road safety element in most of its road and highway projects. These efforts have
focused on some aspects of the "engineering" and "education" components of a road safety
program at the project level (e.g., road safety audits, traffic safety awareness campaigns) on NHAI
and state road projects. None had a positive and lasting effect in addressing India's road safety
problems. In its operations in the India road sector, ADB has not made sufficient use of the Road
Safety Guidelines for the Asian and Pacific Region that were the output of an ADB regional
technical assistance in 1998.22 The guidelines cover 14 factors affecting road safety and all have
relevance to India. With the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways establishing a
central Road Safety Directorate and allocating funding for road safety, there may now be an
opportunity for ADB to provide TA at a central level to develop a sustainable national road safety
program. The importance of including specific road safety activities in future TA projects and loans
is highlighted by the forecast given in Figure A8 below, which compares estimated future trends
for traffic fatalities in India and the People's Republic of China with those in Japan. This suggests
that almost 140,000 persons a year may die on India's roads by 2020 unless steps are taken to
stop the present trend. Japan is able to keep its traffic deaths consistently below 10,000 per year.

31.     The regulations and standards for both drivers and vehicles using India's roads need to
be improved. Although a number of regulations exist, a common problem is their enforcement,
including corruption that undermines enforcement. Future TA projects could explore the
possibility of streamlining the level and procedures for driver training, testing, and licensing,
particularly for commercial operators of trucks and passenger services. Similarly, standards for
motor vehicles could be included for updating to cover both mechanical and emissions testing
with a review of the testing procedures and frequency combined with a particular focus on
improving the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles (trucks and passenger vehicles). The TA
could also include the development of a strategy to encourage multi-axle heavy trucks and of a
mechanism to introduce a formal vehicle scrapping process, including the systematic removal of
the vehicle's registration from official records. Advice would also be provided to help reduce the
amount of corruption involved in regulation, licensing, and registration.

1.      Table A9.1 provides a rating for each project, completed as well as ongoing. On a
relative basis, the road subsector projects are likely to be more successful than those in the
railway subsector. This is in line with the general trend in other countries.

3.      Chapters III and VI of the main report substantiate the rating for relevance of both
completed and ongoing projects. Chapter V of the main report and the subsequent section of
this appendix discuss the efficiency of the completed projects; chapter IV of the main report and
Appendix 6, the implementation efficiency of the ongoing projects. Chapter V discusses the
efficacy of all the projects. Chapter V and Appendix 11 discuss the sustainability of the projects,
and chapter V and Appendix 12, the likely impacts of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
projects.

4.    Four projects in the road and highway subsector and two projects in the railway
subsector are complete. The efficiency of these projects is evaluated below.

          1.       Road and Highway Subsector

5.      Loan 918. Although the quality of work was satisfactory, project completion was delayed
by more than 4 years. The cost of original design was substantially underestimated and the
contract values exceeded the appraisal estimates by 69%. This lowered the project economic
internal rate of return (EIRR) at completion compared with the appraisal estimate. A
postevaluation conducted in 2002 resulted in a still lower but acceptable EIRR of 20.7%.2 The
lower EIRR also reflected the overall optimistic forecast made at appraisal. Also during
postevaluation, the income elasticity of demand was reduced to reflect the actual situation.
Project implementation was less satisfactory because of the poor delegation of responsibilities
to the advisory consultants and the lack of familiarity of the executing agencies with the
Federation of Consulting Engineers contracts. This created conflicts between the executing
agencies and the consultants. To add to the problems, the project included a realignment that
led to an environmental controversy in Tamil Nadu,3 causing a temporary suspension in
construction activities. However, despite these implementation issues, the EIRR at completion
was higher than the benchmark 12%. Hence, the project is rated efficient.

6.       Loan 1041. The completion of this project was delayed by 3 years, and there was a 20%
cost overrun. Similar to Loan 918, traffic forecasts at appraisal turned out to be over optimistic.
At project completion, traffic growth and demand elasticities were scaled down. This resulted in
a fall in the EIRR to 12.1%. Of the seven subprojects, one had a negative EIRR of -0.4%, while
three others had EIRRs of less than 12%. Project implementation was delayed, as detailed in
Appendix 6. Start-up delays were caused by (i) delays in establishing implementation units,
(ii) nonavailability of government clearances, and (iii) land acquisition and clearance of trees
and other utilities. However, despite these implementation issues, the EIRR at completion was
higher than the benchmark 12%. Hence, the project is rated efficient.

7.       Loan 1274. Little information is available on this project in ADB files. The fact that the
project was approved in 1993 and the project completion report has yet to be prepared indicates
a lack of efficiency on the part of both ADB and the Government of India. The base EIRR at
appraisal was estimated at 37%. Allowing for optimistic forecasts, project delays, and lower
traffic growth, it is perceived that the EIRR at completion will still be above the benchmark 12%.
In view of this, the project is rated efficient.

8.      Loan 1747. This project was inspected by the Operations Evaluation Mission and found
to be of satisfactory quality. However, project completion was delayed by 19 months because of
problems with the international contractors. The executing agency provided extra contractual

assistance in the form of advance monthly payments. However, the project had no cost
overruns. Economic analysis on this project has yet to be carried out, although initial reports
indicate that the actual traffic is less than that estimated at appraisal. The project EIRR
estimated at appraisal was 25%. Taking into consideration the lower growth in traffic, the EIRR
could be less than 25% at completion. However, it is expected to be above the benchmark 12%,
in any case. In view of this, the project is rated efficient.

          2.        Railway Subsector

9.     Loan 857. Project completion was delayed by more than 5 years and one component was
delayed by more than 11 years.4 While the main reason for the delay was the deferral of the
Government of India's approval for the importation of the locomotives, the lack of familiarity of the
Indian Railways with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement also contributed to the problems. The
EIRR at completion, 15%, was lower than the estimated EIRR at appraisal (24.5%) but still above
the benchmark 12%. The project is, therefore, rated efficient.

10.     Loan 1140. Project implementation was delayed by 2.5 years because of procurement
delays. The delays were attributable to the Indian Railways and the nonperformance of
contractors due to security problems in the project area.5 Several loan covenants were not
complied with. Project management was found to be wanting in several areas,6 and this was
further exacerbated by the large number of project components. The EIRRs of various
components are given in Table A9.3. Since all the EIRRs at completion were higher than the
benchmark 12%, the project is rated efficient.

     ASSESSMENT OF ACHIEVEMENT OF ADB'S GOALS IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR

1.    Although not stated explicitly and systematically in strategy and program papers, the
Asian Development Bank's (ADB's) sector goal for India's transport sector over the past
2 decades, as summarized by the evaluation team, have encompassed:
      (i)     infrastructure physical development and capacity enhancement,
      (ii)    institutional strengthening and capacity building of transport agencies, and
      (iii)   poverty reduction through infrastructure-led growth.

2.      The first goal has been mostly achieved or is being achieved in the different subsectors,
subject to the resolution of the implementation issues highlighted in Appendix 5. The second
goal has been partly achieved by virtue of some improvements in subsector management being
demonstrated by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Madhya Pradesh Road
Development Corporation, and the major ports, although more progress is required in agency
coordination, road safety, asset management, and operation and maintenance of national
highways and state highways. The last goal has been partly achieved in the national highway,
state highway, railway, and port projects, since the achievements have been limited to providing
indirect benefits. In rural roads, the evidence suggests that some poverty-related benefits will be
achieved once ADB-supported rural road projects are fully operating and on the assumption that
ADB and the executing agencies pay closer attention to the intended "social inclusion"
objectives of the projects. The following factors contributed to the underachievement of these
goals.

3.      First, some ADB-supported projects were based on overly optimistic traffic forecasts,
notably on the Surat-Manor Tollway1 and for the ports of Bombay (Mumbai) and Kakinada.2 The
overestimates of traffic using the ports, combined with the delays during implementation,
resulted in economic internal rates of return on completion being less than estimated at
appraisal but still in the satisfactory to highly satisfactory range. However, in the case of the
ports, the assumptions made at appraisal related to traffic having full use of the new
infrastructure on its completion proved to be incorrect. Similarly, even though the Surat-Manor
Tollway has been open to traffic for almost 1 year, access to the new facility is constrained by
ongoing construction to connect other sections of NH8 closer to Mumbai. As a result, traffic on
the tollway is less than the estimate at appraisal. Once the other projects are completed, the
traffic levels should increase. Despite the lower-than-expected traffic and delays in
implementation, the economic internal rates of return for completed transport projects all exceed
12%, some by considerable margins.

4.      Second, project implementation delays associated with public sector loans in the
transport sector are the norm rather than the exception in India, with no apparent improvement
over time. The delays ranged from 9 months to 5.5 years, and averaged more then 2.6 years for
12 completed projects. The longest delays occurred in the early road projects, where
inexperienced public works departments were the executing agencies and the projects involved
several states, and in railways. While project implementation delays are common in most ADB
public sector loans across countries and sectors,3 the magnitude, impact, and causes of such

    Across sectors and countries, since 1998, the average delays for ADB-financed projects (measured by loan closing
    dates) for all sectors is 0.8 year for the People's Republic of China, 1.4 years for Sri Lanka, 1.7 for Thailand, and
    2.4 years in the Philippines.
                                                                                              Appendix 10     141


delays in the India transport sector need special attention from ADB and the Government. The
impact of the delays includes deferred project benefits and charges for higher interest during
construction. The delays also result in higher ADB loan commitment charges incurred by the
Government of India. These issues could be attributed to inappropriate project scheduling at
appraisal. Project designs need to adopt more realistic schedules that reflect the risks of
unforeseen delays. There are also questions about whether ADB and the Government seriously
screen projects for readiness or take the loans to ADB's Board prematurely to meet annual
lending targets.

5.        Third, the focus on the National Highway Development Program, port connectivity, and
Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana programs to improve and expand the national highways
network and rural roads is resulting in priority being given to road construction and upgrading,
with little regard for network planning and integrity (including the need for access controls and
improved interface between national highways and urban road networks); appropriateness of
standards (e.g., paving roads in rural areas with low traffic volumes); traffic operations
(particularly at state border crossings); and systematic road maintenance. NHAI is reputedly
delaying operation and maintenance considerations because of the higher priority given to the
six-laning of the Golden Quadrilateral national highways. For the same reason, recommended
road safety remedial measures arising from road safety audits on ADB-funded projects are
being postponed. Traffic accidents on India's roads continue to increase in number and severity
as the network is expanded, roads and highways are improved, and vehicle speeds increase,
and little provision is made for improving general safety awareness, introducing effective
enforcement of traffic laws and regulations, or ensuring safe-crossing facilities for pedestrians.
ADB's projects and technical assistance projects assessed appear to have been less than
effective in addressing India's serious road safety problem.

6.      Fourth, ADB's participation in transport sector projects in India has been primarily
focused on engineering, procurement, construction, i.e., relating to civil works and capital
investments, with little apparent consideration of developmental project elements, whether
stated or implied within the project objectives.4 The developmental elements include, but may
not be limited to, progress made in institutional capacity building (particularly with respect to the
operation and likely sustainability of new systems and procedures), social objectives (including
poverty reduction and gender equality), and ways to improve safety during construction and on
project completion. ADB project loan documents would benefit from the inclusion at the outset of
objectively verifiable indicators and targets agreed on by ADB and the Government to
strengthen monitoring, and those relating to project goals and objectives. These indicators and
targets could be used for closer monitoring of projects by both ADB and the Government during
implementation. Agreements were reached with the World Bank on a joint monitoring framework
for transport sector projects as mentioned in the current country strategy and program
(Appendix 11), but the evaluation team found no evidence to suggest that the performance
indicators are being routinely used by ADB staff. The evaluation team also noted that the
framework for the transport modes could usefully include socioeconomic indicators.

7.    Fifth, several of the recent loans appear to be overly ambitious, poorly designed, and
based on incomplete analysis of the causes of the problems facing the sector. ADB
underestimated the potential complexity and difficulties of carrying out such far-reaching reforms.
Both NHAI and Indian Railways are pursuing subsector and policy reforms, but at their own pace.

4
    As a result, the evaluation team found little incremental "value addition" of ADB's involvement in either state
    highways or rural road improvement projects, compared with those projects funded by others, including the
    Government of India.
142       Appendix 10



Many of the ADB transport sector loans in India have included too many conditions, many of
which are nonbinding, too vague, and ineffective. In several cases, the loan covenants have
contributed to project implementation delays.5 In any event, compliance with all the conditions
may not have guaranteed the achievement of the main purpose, which has been to:
        (i)    establish responsibility for managing roads, highways, and railways by clearly
               defining roles for government organizations;
        (ii)   create ownership of roads by involving road users in their management;
        (iii)  ensure a stable, secure, and adequate flow of funds for roads, highways, and
               railways; and
        (iv)   strengthen transport sector management6 by introducing sound business
               practices and management accountability.

8.       Sixth, ADB's projects have consistently used the project implementation unit model for
project implementation. This requires the transfer of staff from their parent organizations, such
as the Public Works Department. While this does provide a focus on implementing the ADB
project, there may be a tendency to divert more talented staff to the project implementation
units, thereby weakening the day-to-day business and responsibilities of the public works
departments. Discussions with public works departments indicated that the combination of a
recruitment freeze (to reduce costs) and staff attrition due to retirement and transfer to project
implementation units, has led to a decline in performance of the parent department vis-à-vis the
project implementation unit. In several ADB projects, there have been delays during
implementation caused by inadequate staffing or performance of the project implementation
units, even with support from the state Public Works Department and--in the case of
Chhattisgarh--from ADB directly. However, it needs to be recognized that the project
implementation unit model has been effective in streamlining the project implementation and
has become a familiar model for government departments to adopt, over the years. Despite its
laws, it is still an effective model for implementing ADB projects.




5
    In the case of the Madhya Pradesh Program Loan, the labor rationalization requirement was found to be difficult to
    implement. In a number of cases, the evaluation team was informed that implementing ADB's environmental and
    social safeguards tends to delay projects, although no direct link could be identified in this regard. Another example
    is the procedure established for approving subprojects by ADB headquarters in Manila, which tends to lengthen the
    process.
6
    Transport sector management refers to the creation of a commercially-oriented transport sector and its responsible
    agencies to manage roads and highways, railways, ports, and inland waterways transport (and air). The purpose is
    to ensure that transport users receive value for money from sector spending by the agencies. The concept
    envisages the establishment of clear management objectives, effective management structures, competitive terms
    and conditions for employment, consolidated budgets, commercial costing systems, a level playing field for
    competitive services sector-wide, and effective management information systems with benchmarked targets and
    publicized performance indicators and results. The concept also includes the efficient use of plant and equipment,
    transparent tendering processes, and a focus on the contracting out of services as far as possible, effective
    controls on vehicle overloading (passengers and freight), and improved safety for transport system users.

                          SUSTAINABILITY OF ADB-ASSISTED PROJECTS

A.        National Highways

1.       The sector assistance program evaluation (the evaluation) included a study to evaluate the
financial planning, cash-flow management, and resource augmentation possibilities for the
National Highway Development Program (NHDP) of the National Highways Authority of India
(NHAI). This study has resulted in the development of a financial forecast model for the NHDP in
conformity with the financing plan prepared by the core group that was set up within the
Committee of Infrastructure by the Prime Minister1 to coordinate the financial planning for NHDP.
This was a standalone planning exercise for NHDP, without taking into consideration the funding
needs of other similar infrastructure development programs and the market appetite for long-term
debt to finance infrastructure projects. A large, multiyear public-private partnership program has
been assumed. NHAI has been successful so far in inviting private sector participation, and it
appears that the private sector is willing to invest in NHDP projects, although there may be
limitations on the number of sponsors in India. If and when other competing sectors or subsectors
(e.g., energy, health, water supply and irrigation, pipelines, ports, railways, urban transport) are
opened more widely to private sector investments, the investment flow is likely to be determined
by the relative attractiveness of the competing opportunities.2

2.        Critical results displayed by the financial model developed by the evaluation study relate to
the yearly funding gap, cumulative funding gaps, sensitivity tests with nominal budgetary support
from the Government of India besides the cess and toll surpluses, and charts for total fund
utilization, capital and maintenance expenditures, funding gap, and cumulative market borrowing
corresponding with the cumulative funding gap. These results have been analyzed for the cash-
flow period 2006­2030. Given below are the summary results of the financial model.

3.       The financial study analyzed sustainability from the point of view of the funding gap and
the ability of NHAI to fill the gap. The NHDP core group has considered market borrowings on a
net requirement basis, i.e., the deficit between the estimated expenditure under phases I­VII
(including payment of annuities and interest cost on market borrowings) and receipts. The
financial study followed the same principle in estimating the funding gap each year and the
corresponding requirement for market borrowings. Cumulative total outstanding balances for
market borrowings were derived by including debt repayments proposed and interest liabilities
outstanding. Debt repayment used for the evaluation study is the same volume of funds as in the
report of the core group. Charts showing the funding gap and cumulative market borrowings
outstanding for each year of the analysis period are in Figures A11.1 and A11.2. Figure A11.1
illustrates the scenario with no maintenance by NHAI, and Figure A11.2 illustrates the scenario
with NHAI maintenance.

    Evidence of the growing market tightness is seen in market reports that state that NHAI was not able to raise
    enough funds through the bond market in the last 3 years (Source: CRIS INFAC Report on Roads and Highways,
    October 2005, www.crisinfac.com).

4.     The plots for the initial period are largely congruent under both scenarios when the
maintenance liability rests with the concessionaires. In the first scenario adopted by the core
group, NHDP appears to repay its liabilities faster in the last years of the analysis period as no
                                                                                                       Appendix 11       145


  further costs accrue to the program. However, since the maintenance liability is transferred to
  NHAI at the end of the concession period, the funding gap persists (Appendix 9). Because of
  financial and human resource concerns, the national highways portfolio was rated as less likely
  to be sustainable. This is a major concern and identifies issues that need to be considered by
  both the Government of India and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

  5.      Some amendments have been made in the financial projections to account for critical
  sustainability features resulting from the life-cycle costs of the NHDP. Assets transferred to NHAI
  after the build-operate-transfer concession period have to be maintained by NHAI. The costs of
  maintenance will, therefore, be borne by NHAI. Following the life-cycle costing pattern for all
  NHDP phases, the allocation of maintenance costs has been made in this study. The study
  showed that it may be possible to partly offset the maintenance costs to NHAI if toll collection
  beyond the concession period is permitted on all roads including the two-lane development under
  NHDP IV. The core group's financial planning was conducted on the basis of expenditures
  planned (including payments of annuities) and identifiable sources of finance from the
  Government of India in the form of tax revenue and toll collection. The funding gap arrived at after
  matching costs and sources is proposed to be financed with market borrowings.

  6.         The financial sustainability indicators for the NHDP are summarized in Table A11.1.

        1.      State Highways: Madhya Pradesh

8.      The financial position of most state governments remains weak because of their high
level of debt obligations and the guarantees extended to various infrastructure and other
projects. Even the progressive states could find it difficult to disburse adequate funds for road
rehabilitation and maintenance. In the case of Madhya Pradesh, while there has been an
improvement in the fiscal deficit position and the state government has been making efforts to
provide adequate funds for rehabilitation and maintenance, the state government's debt
obligations remain an issue (Table A11.3).

9.     Although the Madhya Pradesh state government has discouraged the establishment of a
dedicated road fund, it is committed to ensuring that rehabilitated roads are maintained
adequately. The current pace of reforms in the state is appropriate and sustainable. The level of
technical resources available within the Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation as
well as Public Works Department remains a concern, given the current recruitment freeze and
the gradual attrition resulting from staff retirements and transfers to project implementation units.
To address this matter, the Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation intends to recruit
technically qualified staff directly to create a more sustainable human resource base. Taking
into consideration the improvement in the fiscal deficit position of Madhya Pradesh, the state
highway projects in the state are deemed sustainable. This rating assumes that continued
budget allocations are supplemented with long-term funding from development partners. On the
                                                                                                                Appendix 11       149


other hand, it is still too early to assess the sustainability of state highway projects in
Chhattisgarh where reforms and project implementation are at an early stage.

10.    The evaluation financial study included an analysis of the expenditure profile for life-
cycle costs of different class of assets--state highways, major district roads, other district
roads/village roads. Planning assumptions for the period 2005 to 2025 are as follows:
       (i)      All state highways are likely to be rehabilitated by 2011;
       (ii)     All major district roads are likely to be rehabilitated by 2019;
       (iii)    All other district roads/village roads will be rehabilitated by 2024; and
       (iv)     Routine and periodic maintenance will be in accordance with the Ministry of
                Roads Transportation and Highways/Indian Roads Congress norms.

11.     Total expenditure on all types of road assets (state highways, major district roads, and
other district roads/village roads) is presented in Figure A11.4.

12.   The average yearly expenditure required for the period of analysis is around Rs10 billion
($222 million), excluding the staff and establishment costs of Public Works Department and the
Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation. The funding gap is profiled in Figure A11.5.

13.     As is evident, there persists a funding gap of Rs2 billion in the initial planning years. This
funding gap reduces after 2012 on account of a reduction in expenditure on state highways,
these having been rehabilitated in full and there being no conversion of major district roads into
state highways during the analysis period.

14.      The funding gap could be bridged by market borrowings and extra-budgetary resource
augmentation. If the program is pursued as assumed, there exists relatively less serious threat
to its sustainability unless the state dilutes its priority of road sector development or accelerates
the rehabilitation of major district roads and other district roads/village roads.

                    2.             Rural Roads

15.    The centrally sponsored Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana has a planned
expenditure of about $10.56 billion (Table A11.4). Until December 2006, aggregate funds
available from budget allocations, tax collections, and external assistance from the World Bank
and ADB totaled $9.2 billion, for a shortfall of more than $1 billion. The Central Road Fund Act
provides for the use of 50% of the diesel tax for rural roads. Development partners have
approved loans totaling $2.05 billion for rural roads. The Government of India will need to fill the
funding gap of $1.36 billion in the medium term.

                       SOCIOECONOMIC EFFECTS OF ROAD IMPROVEMENTS

1.      The infrastructure-poverty linkage is indirect, as illustrated in Figure A12.1 below.1 A
review of the literature2 found that (i) economic growth is positively affected by the stock of
infrastructure assets, and (ii) income inequality declines as infrastructure quantity and quality
improve. As regards transport interventions, the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Strategies
Sourcebook indicates that improvements in transport have the greatest impact on poor people
when other sectoral interventions are adequately in place. Without good transport, many other
sectoral interventions are likely to be ineffective.3

2.      A comparison of the impact of various public investments on poverty reduction indicates
that roads have an important contribution. Studies in various Asian countries indicate a variable
correlation between roads and poverty reduction (Table A12.1). In India, this correlation
between roads and poverty reduction is ranked at the top of the scale.

3.      This evaluation of the transport sector included a socioeconomic study of the road and
highway subsector in selected parts of Gujarat and Maharashtra (Surat-Manor Tollway, national
highways 8), and state highways and rural roads in Madhya Pradesh. The evaluation also tried
to assess issues for the recent trend in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) road and highways
projects related to increased social integration for infrastructure projects. The socioeconomic
assessment was aimed at:
        (i)    measuring the socioeconomic and cultural changes resulting from the
               improvement of roads, such as changes related to livelihood patterns, industrial
               development, road safety, HIV/AIDS cases and trafficking risks, access to market
               areas, and farm-gate prices;
        (ii)   identifying key issues in the transport sector and assessing how the road
               improvement projects have addressed these issues; and
        (iii)  assessing and establishing the linkage of socioeconomic improvements and
               livelihoods with road development.

4.      A sampling of areas was undertaken covering the three categories of roads for the
following reasons:
        (i)    National highways contribute to the national economy and indirectly affect local
               economies through industrialization, increased mobility, and increased economic
               opportunities.
        (ii)   State highways affect the regional economies, while also serving as links
               between the rural economies and the state and national economies.
        (iii)  Rural roads have localized impacts by providing access to remote rural
               communities and farmers.

5.       The areas were selected to reflect a representative sample of all social categories and
groups, which may be considered generally typical of other parts of the country. The
assessment used a process of preliminary social profiling and impact analysis of the study area
affected by the selected national, state, and rural roads. The assessment drew on consultations
with local stakeholder groups, semistructured interviews with representatives of social groups,
and a review of available secondary data to identify local perceptions of impacts. For rural
roads, a comparison of with-road and without-road scenarios was carried out in villages in two
districts of Madhya Pradesh. Some of the villages had all-weather road connectivity, while
others were without a road connection. The results of the socioeconomic study are summarized
in Table A12.2.

6.      National Highways. For the lowest-income groups, because of the absence of
investment resources, the national highways did not act as a socioeconomic change agent. The
economic benefits and opportunities created by the national highways increased growth and
investment opportunities for the more well-off groups by increasing asset value, reducing
transportation times and vehicle operating costs, and facilitating trade and business
opportunities. On the national highways, evidence was found that people living in other urban
areas were investing in rural areas along the upgraded highway, thus obtaining economic
benefits from the project. These findings suggest that the likely impact of national highway
projects is substantial but that the impact on reducing poverty at the local level has been
somewhat less than expected (Box A12.1).

7.      State Highways. On the state highways, the broad findings of the socioeconomic study
in Madhya Pradesh indicated that the impact of the road improvement on local communities was
similar to that of the national highways with a few differences. Table A12.3 provides specific
examples of these impacts. Before the Multai-Chindwara state highway was improved,
traditional untrained dais4 used to attend child births in most of the villages in the vicinity of the
state highway. Now, most childbirths take place in local hospitals. In the case of the Khandwa-
Harda state highway, village discussions indicated that the improvement of the state highway
contributed to a reduction in maternal deaths during pregnancy because of better access to
medical assistance. The state highway improvement also affected land prices in the area (Table
A12.4). After the road was completed, land prices generally doubled or tripled. In only one
village was the price of agriculture land constant.

8.    Rural Roads. The study found a positive correlation5 between road improvements and
enhancement of the socioeconomic status of the villagers in the communities through:
      (i)   better access to employment opportunities via improved connectivity (improved
            roads and new or better road transport services) to other villages, towns, and
            cities (Table A12.5);
      (ii)  more local employment and better wages in the villages as a result of the
            increase in commercial enterprises and economic growth in the village;
      (iii) increase in deposits and loans at the newly-established local bank offices;
      (iv)  decline in infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate as a result of improved
            access to medical facilities, enabling trained medical practitioners to attend more
            births;
      (v)   decreases in the dropout rate from primary and middle schools and an increase
            in girls traveling outside the villages for high school and college education;
      (vi)  better prices for farmers through direct sales of agricultural crops at mandis (local
            markets) instead of via middlemen, thereby improving the farmers' profit margins;
            and
      (vii) easier travel for the poorest groups (men and women) outside the villages in
            search of work opportunities in larger urban areas (Box A12.2).

    These findings are based on primary data collected by the evaluation team.
162       Appendix 12




                             Box A12.2: Impact of Rural Road Improvement
Six of the 14 villages covered by the Operations Evaluation Mission survey did not have any public transport
provisions, such as government or private bus or minibus service, before the road construction. After the rural road
construction, bus service (privately operated services) began in five of the six sample villages. In other villages with
existing bus services, there were improvements in the frequency of bus service. For instance, in Hiwarkhed district of
Prabhatpattan block in Betul, no buses served the village before the road was built; now there are 10 buses from the
village to the district center. The road construction has led to enhanced accessibility for the local rural communities to
socioeconomic services such as health centers, markets, and employment opportunities by reducing the travel time
by 50% or more in most cases.

In terms of travel cost, road improvement has had a mixed impact. The new travel fare is lower than the previous fare
in Jeonara and Barodmal villages because of the decline in vehicle operating costs. However, this has not been a
uniform phenomenon in all the villages. The fares were increased in other villages, despite anticipation of lower fares.
Appendix 10 provides more details on these indicators.

9.     From the data collected by the study, the rural road projects are likely to have a very
substantial impact.

10.     The most significant findings of the socioeconomic study were that, although the road
infrastructure improvements have contributed to reducing human poverty in the project areas by
improving access to economic opportunities and social services, the income effects among the
poorest groups have been limited. Another Operations Evaluation Department study6 found that
although the poor have benefited substantially from social impacts through improved access to
transport services, they have not been able to capture all the economic benefits from transport
cost savings because of their indebtedness to traders and the lack of competition on transport
routes.

11.      The evaluation team found limited effective implementation of the objectives in the ADB-
funded projects aimed at addressing social issues such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, transport
safety, trafficking of women and children, and livelihood programs for poor communities in
project areas. The country strategy and program stated that road investments would be
designed to be socially-inclusive projects. The relevant features included enforcement of better
safety standards; education of truck drivers, a high-risk group, on HIV/AIDS; containment of
trafficking of women and children; and livelihood projects for resettled communities. The
evaluation team found very little effort to address these issues, including a lack of monitoring of
progress, or the lack thereof, in achieving the intended outcomes. While attempting to design
road projects to achieve inclusive social objectives is, on paper, clearly desirable, it must be
questioned whether road projects are the most efficient means of achieving such objectives.
Agencies responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining roads are not responsible
for HIV/AIDS education or combating the trafficking of women and children.

               EVALUATION FINDINGS OF OTHER MULTILATERAL AGENCIES

1.     A recent evaluation by the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group identified
several issues specific to the Indian transport sector and suggested broad recommendations for
the World Bank's future assistance (Box A13).

          Box A13: Independent Evaluation Group ­ Issues and Recommendations
                                for the Transport Sector

A.      Issues

         Recent World Bank evaluation identified the following issues for the design of future Bank
assistance in India: (i) the adoption of appropriate design standards and financial mechanisms for the
national highway program, which assumes a very large component of PPPs; (ii) the need for better
integration of rural roads into the state's road networks; (iii) the means to continue a dialogue with the
railways and eventually resume lending; and (iv) the achievement of an appropriate transport portfolio
mix, to ensure that it maximizes the Bank's impact. The most critical question is the future of urban
transport support, where needs are huge and potential rewards high, but projects are complex and
resource intensive.

B.      Recommendations for the World Bank's Transport Sector

1.      Ensure that the focus of the Bank's transport operations goes beyond intercity highways and
        gives more attention to issues of growing urgency, including environmental damages, energy
        efficiency and climate change, traffic congestion, safety, affordability, and trade.
2.      Prepare a Bank Group transport strategy with a sixfold emphasis: (i) greater attention to air and
        water pollution and realizing environmental gains; (ii) achieving greater synergies across relevant
        sectors--building on the merging of the Bank's ESSD and Infrastructure Networks; (iii) enhancing
        knowledge sharing and analytical and advisory services and their contribution to country
        strategies; (iv) continuing to support private sector participation through close coordination among
        the Bank, IFC, and MIGA; (v) increasing attention to governance and corruption issues; and
        (vi) redeploying staff and budget resources accordingly.
3.      Build up the sector's monitoring and evaluation efforts and align them with the new strategy,
        including through (i) the development over the next year of relevant intermediate indicators
        applicable to the broad range of projects; (ii) the launching of an enhanced program of rigorous
        impact evaluations for selected programs; (iii) a comprehensive self-evaluation of the experience
        with SWAps within 3 years; and (iv) an independent overview of the SSATP Program within 2
        years.

ESSD = Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development (Network), IFC = International Finance Corporation,

  MANAGEMENT RESPONSE TO THE SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EVALUATION
       FOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN INDIA--FOCUSING ON RESULTS


         On 19 October 2007, the Director General, Operations Evaluation Department, received
the following response from the Managing Director General on behalf of Management:


       I.     General Comments

       1.      We appreciate OED's Sector Assistance Program Evaluation (SAPE) for
       the Transport Sector in India. We find it comprehensive and well-analyzed,
       covering all key aspects of ADB's assistance to the transport sector in India,
       particularly the roads and railways subsectors. We note that the SAPE will
       provide valuable insights for the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
       India, which is currently under preparation.

       2.       We note that the SAPE rated ADB's transport sector assistance to India
       partly successful overall, but on the higher side. The SAPE rating is determined
       largely due to its assessment on efficiency ("less efficiency") and sustainability
       ("less likely to be sustainable'). The SAPE also rated the overall impact of ADB's
       transport sector assistance modest in comparison to the overall needs of the
       country. Furthermore, ADB's performance is rated partly successful.

       3.       We agree in general with the SAPE assessment. Regarding the
       implementation efficiency and sustainability, we note that ADB has been making
       efforts to mitigate the implementation delays and to explore various means,
       including public-private partnerships and institutional capacity building, to help
       ensure sustainability of developmental impact in all of the technical, financial, and
       institutional aspects. On the impact of ADB's assistance, given the advanced
       stage of development the country is in, and the scale of the country's
       developmental needs and undertakings, we believe it is natural that ADB's
       contributions to the country's developmental process have been modest.

       II.    Comments on Specific Recommendations and Follow-Up Actions

       4.      Implementation delays and ADB supervision. We agree with the
       SAPE suggestion that implementation delays should be a focus of ADB's
       portfolio management. We note that implementation delays have indeed been a
       major concern under ADB-assisted transport projects in India. At the strategic
       level, ADB's South Asia Department (SARD) declared project implementation as
       the top operational priority in 2006 and 2007 and intensified interactions with the
       Government on implementation issues. The Government of India (GOI) and ADB
       recently instituted several measures to address implementation delays. These
       measures include: (i) regular, quarterly tripartite portfolio review meeting, (ii)
       training on project implementation, and (iii) devoting an increasing share of our
       staff resources for project supervision.

       5.       GOI and ADB started quarterly tripartite portfolio review meetings,
       involving oversight and line agencies of the Government and ADB at a senior
       level, to discuss implementation issues and agree on corrective actions on each
individual project. We have been providing complementary assistance to GOI
through hands-on training on project management and workshops on
procurement, disbursement, and safeguards compliance, for executing agency
officials. We are also now devoting an increasing share of our staff time for
project implementation. In the transport sector, 42% of the field work was on
project implementation (the rest is for project processing) in 2006. This would
further strengthen in 2007 with 56% of field work on project implementation and
per-project inputs of 27 staff-days for field review.1

6.      We note that with these efforts, disbursements increased from $161
million in 2005 to $440 million in 2006. It is estimated that disbursements will
further increase to $550 million in 2007. As forward-looking efforts, GOI and ADB
have adopted ex-ante measures of project readiness filters to be used from the
project preparation stage so that delays could be managed from the outset. This
work process has proven to be effective as demonstrated in the case of Rural
Roads Multitranche Financing Facility (MFF) Project 12 (first year contract awards
of 95% and disbursement of 47%) and Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sector
Project II3 (first year contract awards of 75%). With these positive results, we are
continuing and intensifying the efforts.

7.     ADB staffing. In general, we agree with the SAPE's suggestion that ADB
find ways to match the number and quality of staff to the increasing level of
transport operations. However, we note that the provision of further quality staff
resources to the transport sector in India has ADB-wide implications and should
be reviewed through the annual Work Program and Budget Framework exercise.

8.      Project design. We agree with the SAPE suggestion that project design
must be improved. We note that project design quality at entry has already been
adopted in practice. Project design takes into account the past lessons and
experience, with realistic implementation schedule. Capacity building technical
assistance is provided to needy executing agencies. Timely implementation of
start-up activities and smooth take-off of project implementation is being ensured
with the adoption of project readiness filters and consequent need of advance
procurement actions. As a result of these efforts, the periods for loan signing and
first contract awards have been sharply reduced for all loans approved since
2005.4

9.     Support private sector participation across transport modes. We
agree with the SAPE suggestion that ADB supports private sector participation
(PSP) in the transport sector. We note that PSP has been and will continue to be

1
    The 1994 Task Force Report on Improving Project Quality recommended two weeks of field time
    per year to be allowed for an ongoing project.
2
    Loan 2248: Rural Roads Sector II Investment Program­Project 1 approved in July 2006.
3
    Loan 2330: Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sector Project II approved in May 2007.
4
    Among the loans approved from 2001 to 2004, the periods from loan approval to loan signing
    and to first contract awards were on average 10.9 months and 25.8 months, respectively. For the
    three loans approved since 2005, these periods have significantly been reduced: for Loan 2248,
    loan signing was 1 month after loan approval, at which time 90% of the contracts were already
    awarded under advance contracting and retroactive financing; for Loan 2330, loan signing and
    first contract awards were 2 months and 4 months after loan approval, respectively; for Loan
    2308: Uttaranchal State-Road Investment Program­Project 1 approved in January 2007, first
    contract awards were 8 months after loan approval.
explored under ADB-assisted transport projects. Types of ADB support vary
depending on the nature of the projects.

10.     For revenue-generating national highways, ADB is currently processing a
$400 million MFF to finance viability gap of build-operate-transfer concessions.
ADB has also helped develop operation and maintenance concession
agreements for the Golden Quadrilateral national highway network for combined
benefits of promoting PSP and helping sustainability. At the state level, ADB has
been supporting PSP for comparatively advanced states, such as Madhya
Pradesh. For the rural roads, ADB has been promoting PSP with construction
and maintenance package work, also to ensure sustainability. In the railway
sector, ADB has been holding dialogue on PSP on both practical applications for
specific railway operations--container services in particular as well as in ancillary
services such as catering and warehousing--and more holistic, strategic
applications. Exploratory discussions are underway.

11.     Reassessment of the approach to policy reforms in Indian railways.
We concur with the CAPE suggestion that ADB reviews its approach in the
railways subsector. We note that the progress of the ongoing reform program will
be assessed during the midterm review mission scheduled for late 2007. The
review will examine, among other things, how ADB's ongoing assistance should
be structured to respond to the current Indian railway needs of increasing
efficiency and improving commercial orientation. The results will be taken into
consideration during preparation of the CPS and possible future collaborations.

12.     Based on regular policy dialogue and periodic programming discussions,
we are of the view that there is room for ADB to play a role in the railway sector,
both in helping meet the financial needs and helping enhance operational
efficiency. Our focus is to collaborate on areas where ADB, as an external
multilateral development partner, could add value and deliver results effectively
and efficiently.

13.     Strengthen policy dialogue. We agree with the SAPE suggestion that
ADB should strengthen policy dialogue. We note that ADB is broadening its
developmental collaboration in the transport sector to respond to the current
priority concerns and challenges, such as road safety, energy efficiency,
intermodal transport system development, and governance.

14.     For road safety, we are considering a TA for preparing a road safety
strategy followed by a specific investment undertaking related to the
enhancement of transport operation efficiency. ADB's ongoing collaboration on
railways and urban transport (advisory technical assistance) will promote
reduction of transport emissions and enhance efficient energy use in transport.
On developing efficient transport systems over different transport modalities,
ADB is processing a technical assistance for intermodal transport strategy. The
sector governance and corruption issues are being taken up at the country level
during the preparation of the CPS. Inclusive development has been adopted as
one of the new CPS thrusts, which is currently under preparation.
                        DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS COMMITTEE


           Chair's Summary of the Committee Discussions on 24 October 2007 of the:

   (i)       Country Assistance Program Evaluation for India

   (ii)      Sector Assistance Program Evaluation for the Transport Sector in India ­
             Focusing on Results

   (iii)     Sector Assistance Program Evaluation for the Energy Sector in India ­
             Building on Success for More Results

   (iv)      Special Evaluation Study on ADB Support to Public Resource Management in
             India


Background

1.      In introducing the topic, OED stated that this Country Assistance Program Evaluation
(CAPE) is the first for India and covers the last 20 years (1986 to 2006), although most of the
analysis focused on the last ten years. The main purpose of the study was to provide input to
the preparation of Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India. India is both a major
shareholder and a borrowing member country with substantial influence on ADB's portfolio.
ADB's assistance to India in the last 20 years has been about $17 billion in public sector
lending, $147 million in TA assistance, and $756 million in ADB's private sector operations.
There are three other Sector Assistance Program Evaluation (SAPE) reports supporting this
CAPE: one each on transport sector, energy, and public resource management. This CAPE
takes into account the findings and recommendations of these three studies. Conforming to the
requirements of DEC, this CAPE has also incorporated the views of the Government of India on
its partnership with ADB. Management agrees with the CAPE's overall rating of "successful",
and concurs with the overall conclusions and key recommendations.

Project processing consumes more staff resources than project administration

2.      To a query by a DEC member, OED confirmed that in the case of India, project
processing consumes more staff resources than project administration in terms of mission
travel. Director General (DG) of the South Asia Department (SARD), indicated that more
resources for portfolio management have been allocated in recent years with improved
performance.

Quality of assistance program has improved over time

3.      One DEC member noted the report's finding that the quality of the assistance program
during the latter 10 years of the evaluation period has improved in comparison to the earlier 10
year period. He added that the report observes that ADB has and could continue to scale up its
assistance to India in the coming years.




                                                                                              1
Assistance to Rural Development

4.       Observing that there was a recent focus by ADB in rural development in India, one DEC
member asked how this would fit into the core of the evolving Long-Term Strategic Framework
(LTSF) plan of ADB. He pointed out that the agriculture sector, perhaps with the exception of
irrigation infrastructure, was not playing a dominant role in the evolving LTSF. Another DEC
member observed that rural and agricultural developments are important to India, and to China,
and asked how ordinary capital resources (OCR) funding could be provided to these sectors in
a viable way. Another member, observing that while the agriculture sector is important for
poverty alleviation and while core priorities under Medium Term Strategy (MTS II) of ADB have
already been chosen, asked OED to elaborate their views on this issue. OED responded that
MTS II does include irrigation infrastructure as a priority 1 sector. OED added that evaluation
results show that agriculture is a challenging sector and if ADB were to continue to be involved
in this sector, then it should know how to manage the risks. In addition, quite often, the solution
to poverty does not lie in the rural areas, but elsewhere where jobs are being created and thus
causing migration. OED further noted that if ADB were to get involved in a sector, it should be
there for a long term and there should be strong country commitment. DG, SARD responded
that ADB is supporting India's rural development program to make the growth process more
inclusive. In 2006, it provided a $1 billion program loan for strengthening rural cooperatives and
improving availability of credit in rural areas. Further, ADB will be providing assistance for
strengthening agribusiness and irrigation infrastructure, and improving water resources
management in selected states over the 2008-2010 period.

Safeguard Policies

5.       One DEC member noted that the report observes that ADB's safeguard policies have
created the perverse effect of the client deliberately avoiding ADB projects that have sensitive
environmental or re-settlement issues. He further added that the report appeals to India to
become more open to dialogue with ADB and the Resident Mission (RM), and to update the
Indian safeguard policies. Another DEC member noted that report was pointing out that ADB's
safeguard policies were adding to the transaction costs of borrowing from ADB, and stated that
if a country is trying to develop its own safeguard policies, how can ADB insist on its own
system and not use the country's system of safeguards. Is ADB going to continue to insist on
using its own safeguard policies or move towards using the country system, he asked. One
DEC member asked OED to clarify what it means by its statement in the report, "in the mean
time ADB should harmonize its approach to common safeguard concerns in India." OED
responded that three major evaluations completed by early this year had fed into the ongoing
safeguard review. The safeguard systems in some countries are strong, while in others they are
weak. In China, and in some states of India, these systems are strong. In other countries, it will
be a very long time before ADB can use these countries' systems. OED would recommend
strengthening these systems progressively in a move towards using them. While many DMCs
would encourage ADB using their safeguard system, many NGOs would oppose such a move.
DG, SARD added that while this is an ADB-wide issue, SARD is making all efforts to find ways
of harmonizing among systems of donors and aligning with the safeguard systems of the
institutions whose projects ADB is supporting.

Resident Mission

6.     Noting that the report appeals to strengthen the India Resident Mission (INRM) and
observing that ADB's largest private sector operation is in India, a DEC member asked if OED


                                                                                                 2
had a specific recommendation to strengthen the private sector activities by the RM. Another
DEC member stated that for a country like India with a large pool of highly qualified economists
and management specialists, there is no reason why the RM could not be strengthened with
more and qualified staff. That would help to improve the dialogue with the Central and State
governments. Another member pointed out that without delegation of appropriate level of
authority to the RM, it would not be able to function effectively. Yet another DEC member said
that as the Management had noted in its response, it is a bank-wide issue and consequently
should be addressed in that context and not in isolation. Another DEC member noted that the
government has specifically emphasized the need for further decentralization to the INRM with
adequate staffing and use of country systems, and changes in business processes for
streamlining ADB's operation in India. He added that decisions on these issues should be
finalized before the CPS is finalized. OED responded that it has consistently advocated
strengthening of resident missions and Management has insisted that it is an ADB-wide issue.
OED has found from its studies that when the resident missions are strengthened, the client, its
executing agencies, and NGOs all get better service. He added that this strategy would require
developing an accountability framework, delegating more authority, and allocating more staff. It
would necessitate in ADB changing its business model. This would have major implication for
ADB, and thus he cautioned that this should be preceded by a major feasibility study. DG,
SARD, while acknowledging that this is an ADB-wide issue, said that in the case of India, they
could not wait for the outcome of ADB-wide review of RM policy. He added that SARD has
found ways to provide additional support to INRM by delegating more responsibilities by
requesting Private Sector Operations Department and the Office of General Counsel to redeploy
a professional staff position each to the INRM. The large operation in India makes it possible to
justify one of each of these specialized staff to be redeployed. In addition, one position from one
of the divisions in SARD also has been reassigned to INRM. Further, the number of National
Officers positions has been increased from 11 to 19.

Number and quality of ADB staff for India operation

7.      A DEC member, noting that the report points out the need for strengthening the quality
and number of staff involved in the India operation, said that both the donor and borrowing
countries should form an alliance to push ADB for necessary reform steps. Noting that the
report points out that ADB had not fully exploited its potential to assist India, another DEC
member asked OED to elaborate more on why this was the case. He asked OED if one of the
reasons why perhaps ADB could not give timely support to India was because of lack of
adequately qualified experts in ADB. He wanted to know if there were other reasons for not fully
exploiting ADB's potential in India. Another DEC member, pointing out that the report makes it
clear that there is a need for specialized expertise in economic and sector work to develop new
funding methodology for public-private partnership etc., asked if ADB would be able to deliver in
this respect. He further asked how long it would take ADB to deliver if it is not already in a ready
state to deliver such services. Another DEC member noted that the government expects ADB's
operations in India to expand to $4 billion per year and asked if ADB would be able to allocate
the necessary staff, technical assistance (TA) funds and other resources to rise up to
expectation. DG, SARD responded that it is crucial to help the Government improve the
capacity to promote public-private partnership (PPP), and so, ADB has provided large scale
technical assistance to set up PPP cells in 14 states. These cells are in charge of identifying
and carrying out preliminary assessment of PPP projects. ADB's support to PPP is expected to
be scaled up.




                                                                                                  3
Coordination between Public and Private Sector Operations of ADB

8.      Noting the report's observation that there is potential for improving the coordination
between ADB's public and private sector operations, and pointing out that there is an ADB
proposal to merge the private sector operations within the public sector operations, a DEC
member asked what OED thought of the plan. Another DEC member pointed out that the report
states that there should be synergy between ADB's public and private sector operations, and
asked what ADB is doing about it. Another DEC member, while agreeing with this view,
observed that the coordination between ADB's public and private sector operations has
significantly improved over the last couple of years. OED responded that it had done an
evaluation report on this issue which was discussed by DEC in June. That study proposed two
or three modes for consideration. Responding to the specific question about merging PSOD
with Public Sector Departments, DG, OED said that the implications for such a change would
have to be considered. He noted that since staff in the public sector are used to designing
projects that are backed by government guarantee, they may not be able to fully appreciate the
risks associated with private sector lending. DG, SARD responded that SARD is actively
pursuing projects in which both the public and private sector work together to achieve project
goals and to bring synergy on development impact through their partnership.

Access to Asian Development Fund (ADF)

9.      Pointing out that the report has classified ADB's assistance program to be successful,
but on the low side, one DEC member asked if the low side rating may have been the result of
India's lack of access to ADF. If India had access to ADF, it could have helped India to eradicate
poverty a little more. He asked what OED thought of this lack of access of ADF to India. He
further noted that there are limits on ADB's assistance to any country and that for major
countries like India, and China, ADB's assistance may be even less than one percent of the
amount needed for development, and asked if ADB could have provided more assistance then
that would have made a difference.

More field office resources for improving project implementation

10.    A DEC member commended OED for recommending that more field office resources
should be added to improve project implementation. He added that ADB should also provide
more support for executing agencies (EA) and other local entities in charge of project
implementation.

Knowledge Services

11.     Observing that demand for knowledge services from middle-income countries like India
and China are likely to increase, a DEC member asked if ADB is ready to meet such demands.
OED responded that clearly knowledge management is an area where ADB could do more but
has not been able to. ADB is not as successful as it would like to be. The main reason is the
skills of the staff. ADB tries to outsource through TAs and consultants; these efforts are
sometimes successful and at other times not so.

Regional Cooperation

12.  Noting that India has been active in promoting South Asia Regional Cooperation, a DEC
member asked why the report did not deal extensively with the issue and/or its recommendation


                                                                                                4
for ADB's assistance to India to participate in regional projects to integrate with the regional
economies. OED responded that there has not been much investment projects in the region.
There has been much policy dialogue that ADB supported. Now there are a few projects, but
they are not completed yet. It would be a good topic for the next CAPE to cover. DG, SARD
added that the first investment project in regional cooperation is soon coming to the Board for its
consideration. It is a project in information communication technology. It is small, but there is an
understanding among the four countries about the benefit to be mutually shared.

World Bank versus ADB

13.     A DEC member asked OED what they thought of the relative performance of the World
Bank (WB) vis-à-vis ADB in providing assistance to their members. OED responded that WB
has three times as many staff in their resident mission in India as ADB has in its resident
mission in India. ADB resident mission staff is under stress. The portfolio of WB in India is
similar to that of ADB. Consequently, with a larger staff, WB can generally do things better than
ADB. They do better in knowledge management, macro-economics etc. They certainly do better
on safeguard policies. It is a difficult comparison, but in terms of resources, WB has much larger
resources than ADB in every country across the region. An OED staff added that in general,
ADB fares better in project management and does poorly in knowledge services and policy
dialogue and that perhaps reflect the quality of ADB's staff resources and its reliance on TAs
and consultants.

Financial Sector Operations

14.      Noting that there were many cancellations in financial sector operation due to lack of
demand and other problems, a DEC member asked why this happened and what could be done
to prevent such a thing from happening in the future. OED responded that due to unaddressed
structural impediments, there were not enough private sector infrastructure projects that would
have met the criteria set by ADB for its credit lines that supported infrastructure projects. In the
housing market, there were enough alternative financing resources available locally at better
rates. Initially, ADB's line of credit looked competitive in terms of pricing. But as domestic
interest rate, exchange rate, and guarantee fees of the government changed ADB funds
became unattractive. INRM staff added that one of the reasons for the low demand for the
loans was that ADB was imposing its safeguards, particularly those relating to re-settlement, on
the sub-borrowers. As these would affect profitability, the private sector borrowers were
reluctant to accept these conditions and borrow. Another reason was that there was surplus of
liquidity in the economy, and the interest rates were not favorable.

Viability of Transport Sector Projects

15.     Recollecting that DG, OED had earlier stated in a previous DEC meeting that internal
rate of return (IRR) calculations of transport sector projects are based on overly optimistic
assumptions, and that these projects on average are delayed by a year and a half, thus
rendering these IRR calculations meaningless, DEC member asked when ADB was going to
learn the appropriate lessons and take action to address these issues.

Anchor Expansion and Lending Volume

16.    The report's recommendation 1(iii) asks ADB to "anchor expansion in lending volumes
and the addition of new sectors and states to a country strategy business plan which ensures



                                                                                                  5
that aspirations are matched by adequate resources". A DEC member noted that the
Management has sidestepped the issue of developing a business plan as part of CPS.

Economic and Thematic Sector Work

17.     A DEC member noted that the economic and thematic sector work as a component of
work program should be agreed with the Government of India as part of CPS rather than being
decided on an ad-hoc basis. He invited DEC to take a position on this issue. He further pointed
out that Management appears to be sidestepping the related recommendation on this issue by
OED.

Headroom for Private Sector Lending

18.     Noting the Management view that use of currency swaps will increase headroom for
private sector lending, one DEC member asked how the currency swaps would increase the
headroom. INRM staff responded that exchange risk is often too much for a private sector
borrower to bear and currency swap is one of the mechanism ADB has by which it eliminates
the foreign exchange risk for the borrower.

Procurement from Non-member countries

19.      Noting that the Government of India has specifically suggested relaxing procurement
restriction from non-member countries for the PPP projects as the Government of India system
is based entirely on competition, one DEC member asked SARD and COSO to respond to this
suggestion. Country Director, India, stated that the first stage of implementation of a PPP
project is to select a partner to undertake the PPP. Under the model concession agreement, the
partner will have to establish a company under the Indian Companies Act. Thus, the nationality
of the company that will do the project will be Indian. Consequently, there is a difference
between the traditional way of procuring civil works and supplies. The Government of India is
requesting ADB to reconsider the way it applies the procurement guidelines. Principal Director,
COSO, responded that procurement from non-member country is a restriction imposed by the
ADB Charter. He added that COSO is looking at this issue in a creative way. It is an important
issue, particularly given the magnitude of the investment needs. He agreed with the analysis of
Country Director, INRM and added that this is a financial engineering in a grand way and that it
is not a procurement of civil works for a simple project. He further added that COSO is
consulting with ADB's legal department and he was optimistic about a good outcome.

Is ADB Operating in too many states for it to be effective?

20.    While acknowledging that it is important to be present in states where there is poverty, a
member asked if ADB is involved in too many states for its operation to be effective. Is the span
of control optimal? Country Director, INRM responded that until 2003, ADB operation was
focused on selective states. In most cases, these states were considered to be reform minded.
As a consequence of ADB's success in these states, several of them are performing better. He
cited several examples to support his argument. This has allowed ADB to expand its
geographical coverage, which is also the wish of the government.




                                                                                               6
Conclusions

21.   DEC Chair drew the following conclusions from the discussion:

      (i)      DEC noted the rating of successful on the low side. Some members emphasized
               that the report should give prominence to the recent period within the 20 year
               period the evaluation covered.

      (ii)     For better performance, what is important is knowledge, quantity and quality of
               resources.

      (iii)    DEC endorsed the policy of infrastructure led poverty reduction, but wanted
               Management to carefully analyze the consistency between LTSF and MTSII on
               the one hand, and emphasis on rural development and agriculture on the other.

      (iv)     Safeguards are important, but there is need to harmonize safeguard standards.
