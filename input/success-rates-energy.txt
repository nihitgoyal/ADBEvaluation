The project aimed to

  for the 1,200-MW Wuqiangxi hydropower scheme being
  constructed upstream; and
 support the institutional development of Hunan Electric
  Power Company, and tariff policy and energy conservation reforms in Hunan Province.

Accomplishments:
The addition of a 270-MW station (including one 30-MW generating unit in addition to the
eight planned originally) accelerated the development of Hunan Province's hydropower
resources and helped relieve current and future power shortages. As the system load grows
and as the Yuanshui River hosts more upstream hydropower projects, the project's operation
is expected to become even more effective. The project has also enabled the Wuqiangxi
hydropower station to increase its peaking capability. With the Lingjintan station able to
reregulate discharges from the Wuqiangxi station, the latter can provide a total of 1,248
gigawatt-hours per year of dependable energy for peaking, equivalent to the increased
availability of more than 150 MW of peaking capacity.

 finance investments in energy efficiency and environmental improvements including
  technological restructuring, and
 introduce modern management systems.


Accomplishments:
All envisaged physical outputs of the project were achieved with actual production
exceeding designed capacity. All subprojects also achieved anticipated energy efficiency
and environmental improvements. Given wide replication throughout the country of the
new production technologies and facilities adopted under the Huaxin Cement Company
Limited, Jinhua Chemical (Group) Corporation, and Tianjin Soda Plant subprojects, as well as
the willingness of domestic commercial banks to lend for similar energy efficiency initiatives,
expected sector-wide demonstration effects were largely realized.

  subsector;

  and increase exports of electricity to Thailand;
 strengthen the capabilities of Electricité du Laos to prepare, design, and implement
  environmentally sustainable projects; and
 strengthen the management and protection of the National Biodiversity Conservation Area
  at Phou Khao Khouay.

Accomplishments:
The Nam Leuk power plant's operational performance was excellent from the commissioning
of the 60-MW hydropower generating station. In its first 3 years of operation, the project
exceeded its expected average long-term capacity to generate 215 gigawatt-hours per year.
This was attributed to favorable hydrology and gave confidence in the project's capacity. From
the project's performance, and considering the hydrological database that went into the
hydrology study, observations support the belief that the power output is strongly renewable
and reliable, and will sustain the project over its life. With diligent operation and appropriate
maintenance, the project is expected to operate for more than its 40-year design life.

  petroleum products and coal,
 encourage increased private sector participation in the gas subsector through the financial
  restructuring of the Gas Authority of India Limited, and
 promote efficient utilization of natural gas by supporting the adoption of market-based
  pricing.

Accomplishments:
The project increased the throughput of the Hazira-Bijaipur-Jagdishpur pipeline from 18 to
33 million standard cubic meters per day, utilizing gas that would otherwise have been flared.
It also met or exceeded other targets, such as providing inputs to the electric power and
fertilizer industries, creating whole new environmentally-friendly markets for compressed
natural gas in Delhi and Mumbai--gas has provided inputs for 4.02 million tons of fertilizer
production annually, 1.57 million tons more than envisaged; 2,483 megawatts (MW) of
electricity generation, 783 MW more than forecast; and 1.1 million tons of ethane/propane/
liquefied petroleum gas, more than double the expected amount. The project also stimulated
substitution of coal in the glass-making industries of Ferozabad and the iron foundries of the
Agra and Mathura Refinery, all of which contributed substantially to the government's policy
to reduce pollution in the area of the Taj Mahal and other historic and heritage monuments.
Through the project and other activities, the Gas Authority of India Limited adopted modern
technologies and best practices, allowing them to match international standards for the gas
industry.

 reduce the extraction of fuelwood for cooking and
  heating,
 curtail expenditure on imported kerosene, and
 provide electricity to poor households and increase their cash incomes.


Accomplishments:
The rural electrification ratio in the country went up from 20% in 1995 to 24% in 1999. About
3,120 households in 110 villages were electrified and 567 electrification kits were provided
at a minimal charge. The beneficiaries unanimously agreed that electricity has brought
about an overall improvement in their quality of life. Beneficiaries began to use electrical
appliances. Children benefited from extra hours available for study. Adults enhanced their
literacy by attending the nonformal education program organized in the evening. Women,
who previously spent much time in the kitchen, experienced a significant decrease in eye and
respiratory ailments caused by excessive indoor smoke from firewood stoves and kerosene
wick-lamps. Electricity boosted income-generating activities such as weaving, carpentry,
carving, and tailoring. Electrically operated rice mills, flour mills, and oil mills increased
supplementary income and employment opportunities. Small shops-cum-bars sprouted
and still operate after dark, thereby increasing commercial activity and social interaction.
Electricity gave beneficiaries security at night, bringing them peace of mind in relation to
medical and other emergencies. Cases of theft, burglary, and vandalism in religious temples,
monasteries, and structures decreased. Electricity has also helped to protect the harvest from
wild animals. In addition, the project provided avenues for recreation and relaxation through
media, such as radio and television, as well as time to associate with neighbors and relatives.
