  conducive to microfinance growth,

  institutional capacity of microfinance institutions, and

Accomplishments:
The project demonstrated that the Grameen Bank approach could be implemented
successfully nationwide. The number of clients who received microfinance services reached
618,906, exceeding the target by 106%. Of these, 97% were women, exceeding the target
of 90%. Savings mobilized also exceeded targets, primarily through the use of compulsory
savings. At project completion, 839 million Philippine pesos in savings had been mobilized,
260% above the target. The project supported the start-up and expansion costs of 505
Grameen Bank approach replicator branches, exceeding the target by 66%. Non-agriculture-
based microcredit programs were consolidated; terminating or consolidating 21 (78%) of
the 27 programs and transferring those to government financial institutions--a significant
increase from the target of 50%. The covenant on removing the interest rate ceiling for
non-agriculture-based microcredit programs was also addressed through the issuance of
Executive Order 138, which directed government financial institutions to operate wholesale
lending based on prevailing market rates. The National Credit Council formulated the
Regulatory Framework for Microfinance in 2002, which specified that savings collected
beyond the compensating balance (i.e., greater than the loan portfolio) should be under the
prudential supervision of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.

The project provided the intended resources to AgriBank
and people's credit funds, and extended rural credit to
135,000 rural borrowers at completion--significantly
exceeding its target by 32%. Partly due to support from the project, AgriBank's clients
increased from less than 3 million at appraisal to more than 9 million in 2004, providing
services to a large number of previously "unbanked" rural residents. The quality of AgriBank's
services also improved with faster processing, better repayment rates (above 95%), fewer
overdue loans (1.74% as of 2004), and more flexible repayment schedules. While rapid
economic growth and rural poverty reduction during the project period are attributable
to many factors, fieldwork showed that rural credit played a key role in achieving these
outcomes through the provision of increased opportunities for the rural poor for private
investment and self-employment.

The program aimed to
 augment the mobilization of long-term resources; and
 improve the efficiency of their allocation through
  a diversified and competitive capital market that encourages broad-based participation
  of issuers and investors.

Accomplishments:
Because of the program, the primary share market recovered for 2004. Transactions in the
secondary share market significantly increased from 2003, market capitalization started
to increase from the same year (reflecting a rapid increase in the index price), market
infrastructure was upgraded largely to the standards recommended by the International
Securities Services Association, the share of investment from the gross domestic product
in leasing assets remained within a range of 0.8%­1.1% from 1994 to 2004, the total size
of mutual funds increased from 2003, and total premiums collected by general and life
insurance companies increased progressively from 1994. Surveys have suggested that the
stock market rally during those years contributed significantly to job creation in the industry
and to the broadening of the investor base in the country including individuals.

  services in the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural
  Cooperatives.

Accomplishments:
As of 2004, the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives had become increasingly
self-reliant and was able to significantly reduce its dependence on government funds,
mandatory deposits from commercial banks, and loans from domestic and foreign sources.
Over a decade, the deposit-loan ratio doubled to 98%. The impacts on farmers' lives included
positive changes in norms and practices, attitudes, women empowerment, and social
organization. Institutional skills and capacities, as well as community relations, were reported
to have improved because of the project, which gave rise to the establishment of village
stores that became venues for trading among farmers and informal gatherings after the
day's work.

Accomplishments:
New standards for trading, trade comparison and trade
resolution, clearance and settlements, registration and transfer of securities, and trade
reporting were adopted. Through the use of more efficient information technology, trades
were matched more efficiently and the liquidity of each security improved. Automated
facilities linked exchange members electronically and allowed them to execute market
transactions instantly. The use of more advanced information technology in the National
Stock Exchange improved transparency of market transactions by generating market
information about volume, prices, and time of transactions leading the National Stock
Exchange to account for about 86% of the trading volume in 2002­2003. Furthermore,
with the development of the National Securities Depository Limited, dematerialization
of securities, and automated securities settlement through the clearing organizations,
inefficiencies and related risks for the individual investor were eliminated. The two
depositories (National Securities Depository Limited and Central Depository Services Limited)
now interface electronically, with automated links to their respective clearing organizations.
In addition to the clarifications provided to investors regarding accounting and taxation
questions on their derivative positions, the move to trading on rolling settlement and the
introduction of individual stock derivatives spurred the growth of the derivatives market--
increasing volumes from 23 billion Indian rupees (Rs) in 2000­2001 to more than Rs1 trillion
in 2001­2002. Single stock futures accounted for more than 50% of the volume. This growth
continued into 2002­2003, with volumes of Rs4.4 trillion. Another leap in volumes appeared
to be occurring in 2003­2004. In December 2003 alone, volumes reached Rs3 trillion, as
compared to Rs0.5 trillion in December 2002, making India the second-largest market for
stock futures in the world.

                                                                   Successful
 strengthen financial intermediaries by facilitating the
  operational and financial restructuring of banks;
 upgrade skills in commercial banks;
 strengthen the legal and regulatory framework, develop the supervision and the
  regulation of banks and nonbank financial institutions, enhance the financial information
  on banks, improve debt recovery, and facilitate enforcement;
 augment the regulatory capabilities of the Bank of Mongolia; and
 boost the efficiency of financial intermediation by reducing the government's involvement
  in commercial bank operations and establishing market-determined interest rates.

Accomplishments:
Macroeconomic stability in the country was achieved, thanks to the program's pioneering
efforts to reform the banking system. The 42.0% annual growth in the money supply in
2002--compared with 19.8% in 1997 and 27.9% in 2001--was a result of substantial financial
deepening and did not affect inflation. The annual inflation rate slowed to 1.6% in 2002,
down from 36.6% in 1997 and 8.1% in 2001. Successful efforts to restore macroeconomic
stability were also reflected in a reduced fiscal deficit of 5.6% of gross domestic product in
2002 (from a fiscal deficit of 9.1% in 1997), which was below the 6.5% target stipulated by the
International Monetary Fund poverty reduction and growth facility. The program contributed
to the gradual development of a market-based banking system through implementation of
policy reforms, formulation of laws and regulations, and strengthening of the capacity of the
Bank of Mongolia and commercial banks.
