                                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

         Road safety is a major issue affecting the road sector. Road accidents remain a serious
impediment to sustainable human development in many of the developing member countries
(DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).a The economic losses from road accidents and
fatalities amount to a high 2-4 percent of gross domestic product in many DMCs. For example,
fatality rates were at a high 80,000 per year in 1998 in India. This technical assistance
performance audit report is the first operations evaluation report on selected technical
assistance (TA) interventions on road safety. As of October 2000, ADB had provided a total of
$5.16 million for 10 TAs. The evaluation includes three of seven completed TAs: TA 5620-REG:
Regional Initiatives in Road Safety,b which was the only TA with a regional scope; TA 2177-
PRC: Preparation of a Road Safety Program;c and TA 2001-IND: Road Safety.d The latter two
were attached to ADB loans in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and India, respectively.

        TA 5620-REG was intended to review road safety problems in DMCs, provide guidelines
for policymakers in the region, and assist ADB in identifying initiatives that could be
implemented throughout the region. The TA also included two regional workshops, the first in
Bangkok, Thailand and the second in Beijing, PRC. In addition, the TA aimed to review the
previous implementation experience and identify lessons for new projects. The entire TA
amount of $600,000 was financed by ADB on a grant basis. TA 2177-PRC was attached to
Loan 1324-PRCe (Heilongjiang Expressway). It aimed to help Heilongjiang Province formulate a
comprehensive highway safety program that would serve as a model for similar programs in
other provinces. TA 2001-IND, which was attached to Loan 1274-INDf (National Highways),
aimed to assist personnel in the Ministry of Surface Transport (MOST) in training and capacity-
building activities in the fields of accident analysis, traffic engineering, and design of low-cost
countermeasures for road accidents.

        The three ADB TAs on road safety were highly relevant and timely. The Operations
Evaluation Mission found that the terms of reference in all the TAs were fully consistent with the
needs of the executing agencies. The executing agencies actively interacted with the TA
consultants during implementation. The TA reports were generally of a high quality. The benefits
of the TAs were significant and generally visible.

        TA 5620-REG significantly contributed to increasing awareness among DMC officials of
road safety. Over 110 officials from more than 20 DMCsg participated in the workshop in
Bangkok and over 450 attended the conference in Beijing,h and benefited very much. All
participants and DMC officials considered the ADB Guidelines on Road Safety prepared under
this TA highly useful and applied them in their work. TA 2177-PRC substantially improved

capacities of the Heilongjiang Public Security Bureau in reducing accident rates along an ADB
road project route (Heilongjiang Expressway) and in improving road safety in the whole of
Heilongjiang Province. Likewise, TA 2001-IND provided useful training to officials from the
Karnataka police and MOST, and developed pilot programs on accident analysis and black spot
identification.

        TA 5620-REG fully achieved its intended objectives and is rated highly successful.
Likewise, TA 2177-PRC is rated highly successful. The Heilongjiang Public Security Bureau is
advised to implement the recommendations of TA 2177-PRC in Heilongjiang Province, with
additional support from an ongoing ADB TA (TA 3341-PRC: Capacity Building in Traffic Safety,
Planning and Management); the Government is advised to widely disseminate the experience to
other provinces.

      TA 2001-IND is rated successful. As Loan 1274-IND is ongoing, the rating is contingent
on the National Highways Authority of India and MOST successfully implementing the TA
recommendations and particularly adopting the safety requirements in the highway safety
manual prepared under the TA. ADB should consider providing additional support in this regard.

         The main message from this evaluation is that road safety has not been accorded the
priority it deserves in the DMCs, including that under earlier ADB-funded projects. The DMCs
should work to reduce accidents by identifying black spots, and more importantly, institute
measures such as safety audits and safety education, which would help prevent these accidents
in the first place.

        The Operations Evaluation Mission conducted extensive consultations with ADB projects
staff, DMC officials, and representatives of other funding agencies (World Bank, Japan
International Cooperation Agency, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation) and identified
several recommendations for improving road safety in ongoing and future ADB projects. The
most important ones that can be implemented as soon as possible are listed below.

       (i)     ADB should actively encourage regional and local activities on road safety in all
               DMCs, involving the private sector and nongovernment organizations.

       (ii)    Specifically, ADB's Guidelines on Road Safety should be widely adopted in all
               ongoing and future ADB road projects. Particularly, ongoing and future ADB TA
               and loan projects in the road sector should require a road safety expert to
               conduct a safety audit of designs and construction works.

       (iii)   ADB should formulate standalone advisory and operational TAs and regional
               TAs and assist DMCs in improving capacities and implementing programs on
               (a) safety audits, (b) safety education campaigns, (c) accident analysis, and
               (d) engineering improvements at black spots.

A.        Introduction

1.      In many developing member countries (DMCs), motorization and vehicle fleet ownership
grew at 15-18 percent annually in the 1980s and 1990s. In the last decade, 30 percent of the
total number of road accidents were fatal in several countries in the region. Economic losses
from road accidents commonly exceed 2 percent of gross domestic product for many DMCs
(para. 8). Thus, road safety is rapidly emerging as a major sector issue. Acknowledging the
importance of road safety, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been assisting DMCs
through technical assistance (TA), which was either attached to individual loans or was regional
in scope.

2.     As of October 2000, ADB had provided a total of $5.16 million for 10 TA projects, one of
which was regional in scope (TA 5620-REG). Eight others were attached to loans. A recent TA
was a standalone advisory TA (ADTA).a Of the seven completed TAs, the Operations Evaluation
Mission (OEM) selected TA 5620-REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety,b together with TA
2177-PRC: Preparation of a Road Safety Program,c and TA 2001-IND: Road Safety,d in the
People's Republic of China (PRC) and India, respectively.e

3.       TA 5620-REG was intended to review road safety problems in DMCs, increase
awareness among DMC officials, provide guidelines for policymakers in the region, and assist
ADB in identifying initiatives that can be implemented throughout the region. The TA also
included two regional workshops, the first in Bangkok, Thailand for over 110 participants from
more than 20 DMCsf and the second in Beijing, PRC. In addition, the TA aimed to review the
previous implementation experience and identify lessons for new projects. The entire TA
amount of $600,000 was financed by ADB on a grant basis. TA 2177-PRC was attached to
Loan 1324-PRCg (Heilongjiang Expressway). It aimed to help Heilongjiang Province formulate a
comprehensive highway safety program that would serve as a model for similar programs in
other provinces and to improve capacities within the Heilongjiang Public Security Bureau
(HPSB) to approach road safety in a systematic manner. TA 2001-IND, which was attached to
Loan 1274-INDh (National Highways), aimed to assist personnel in the Ministry of Surface
Transport (MOST) in training and capacity-building activities in the fields of accident analysis,
traffic engineering, and design of low-cost countermeasures for road accidents, and prepare a
highway safety manual to be used by design engineers. The basic information on the objectives,
scope of activities, implementation schedule, and outputs is in Appendix 1.

B.        Rationale, Objectives, Approach, and Scope of Activities

4.      The main objective of this evaluation was to review and assess for all TAs (i) the
relevance and efficiency in terms of objectives and scope of activities; (ii) their efficacy, in terms
of consultants' performance and quality of outputs; (iii) the sustainability of the outputs; and
(iv) impacts on institutional capacity and policy development. The evaluation also reviewed data
in the various DMCs and analyzed current trends in road traffic accidents, and identified actions
that can be taken, with ADB assistance, to improve road safety.

5.      With regard to TA 5620-REG, the OEM undertook a survey to assess the impact and
sustainability of the major outputs of this TA, i.e., the ADB Guidelines on Road Safety and the
Regional Road Safety Initiative (RRSI). Questionnaires were sent to the (i) participants in the
workshops; (ii) DMC governments; (iii) representatives of executing agencies (EAs) for ongoing
ADB projects with road safety components in PRC, India, Philippines, and Thailand; and (iii) other
international organizations such as the World Bank, Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP), and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).

6.       In addition, the OEM visited the PRC from 27 to 31 August 2000 to review TA 5620-REG
and TA 2177-PRC. It met with government officials and other representatives from road-related
agencies (such as the Heilongjiang Hatong Expressway Corporation [HHEC] and the
Heilongjiang Traffic Safety Management Organization), and inspected the road safety
arrangements under Loan 1324-PRC: Heilongjiang Expressway. The preliminary findings of the
OEM were presented to the relevant operations department of ADB during a workshop on
11 September 2000.i In addition, in the Philippines (from 6 to 12 September 2000), the OEM
interviewed government officials from the Department of Public Works and Highways,
Department of Transportation and Communications, and mayors and representatives from the
traffic safety division in the cities in Metro Manila to review the road initiatives under ongoing
ADB projects in the country and evaluate the impact of TA 5620-REG. The OEM also visited
Thailand (14-16 September 2000) and India (9-19 October 2000) to review TA 5620-REG and
TA 2001-IND, respectively. In Thailand, the OEM met with (i) representatives from ESCAP to
discuss regional initiatives after TA 5620-REG, (ii) government officials dealing with the road
sector in Thailand to review road safety arrangements under ongoing ADB projects, and
(iii) participants in the workshop under TA 5620-REG to follow up on their responses to the
questionnaire. In India, the OEM (i) met with government representatives in the road sector to
review the implementation and impact of TA 2001-IND, (ii) inspected road safety along ADB
road project routes, and (iii) held discussions with participants from India in the workshop under
TA 5620-REG, and representatives from the World Bank, JBIC, and state level agencies
concerned with road safety. The OEM also visited Singapore (20-23 October 2000) to (i) meet
with officials from the National Safety Council of Singapore and the Land Transport Authority;
and (ii) visit the Integrated Traffic Management Center, Safe Driver Testing Center, and the
Safety Park.

7.      Report Organization. The OEM's assessment of the three TAs, in terms of
implementation performance, outputs, and sustainability of impacts, as well as the impact of the
TAs on road safety in the DMCs and on ADB operations, is presented in Section II (with more
detailed information in Appendixes 1-4). Section III contains the key issues and lessons learned,
and an overall assessment of the three TAs (see also Appendixes 5-8). Copies of the draft
report were sent to the DMC governments and ADB staff concerned for comments. All
comments received were considered in finalizing the report.

i
    Ongoing TA 3341-PRC was also reviewed in the discussions in ADB headquarters.

C.        Road Safety in Selected DMCs

8.      Road safety is a serious problem in many DMCs. For example, road accident fatalities
were at an alarming 80,000 per year in India in 1998 and over 16,000 per year in Thailand in
1995. In many DMCs, accidents are not reported nor recorded properly. Except in countries like
Fiji and Singapore, conscious efforts at traffic engineering, education, and enforcement are not
working effectively to reduce road accidents due to various problems.j Nevertheless, some
improvements are visible in Thailand (Appendix 2) and Malaysia, where accidents have been
declining since 1997.

9.       The OEM reviewed road safety-related data on 16 DMCs (Bangladesh, PRC, Fiji, India,
Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea,
Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam).k The main observations pertaining
to this review are as follows:

          (i)      In many DMCs, road safety is the joint responsibility of different agencies and
                   government departments. Therefore, a coordinated multidisciplinary approach is
                   more effective than individual efforts by line agencies (such as, the police or
                   department of public works).

          (ii)     In many DMCs, a national road safety committee exists. The coordination among
                   related agencies is highly effective in DMCs like Fiji and Singapore but is less
                   successful in other countries. Bangladesh and the Philippines reported the least
                   effective coordination. A common problem in many DMCs is the lack of sufficient
                   funds and the credibility of the national committee itself.

          (iii)    Accident data systems were operating practically in many DMCs but generally
                   underreported the actual accident situation. Except in Singapore, accident
                   locations are not accurately identified. The analysis and dissemination of
                   accident information needs significant improvement in many DMCs. There are
                   many discrepancies between what was reported and what actually happened on
                   the road.

          (iv)     Fiji, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand undertake safety audits on road
                   engineering works and remedial works at accident locations. Regular monitoring
                   networks were lacking in many DMCs, notably Bangladesh and India.

          (v)      South Asian DMCs are lagging behind other DMCs in the area of children's
                   education on road safety. In Singapore, road safety is a compulsory activity in
                   primary schools and citizens' groups take an active part in monitoring traffic
                   safety.

          (vi)     Driver training and testing are strictly followed in the PRC and Singapore, but are
                   weaker in many other DMCs, and weakest in India and the Philippines.
                   Nationwide road safety campaigns targeted at road-users at risk are needed in
                   many DMCs. The Philippines and Sri Lanka have recently introduced seat belt

j
    Lack of funds, poor institutional capabilities, and insufficient data are among the common problems.

                   laws. The use of seat belts and helmets for motorcyclists, is still not mandatory in
                   Bangladesh, India, or Nepal.

          (vii)    Few DMCs regularly monitor motor cars and motorcycles for road safety. Buses
                   and trucks are inspected only in Fiji, Singapore, and Thailand. Appropriate
                   procedures to prevent corruption in traffic enforcement are lacking in all DMCs
                   except Singapore. Traffic police lack highway patrols and modern equipment,
                   especially in the South Asian DMCs. In all DMCs, speed limits are not strictly
                   enforced for motor vehicles. Only in Singapore were trucks limited to a speed of
                   50 kph on highways and were monitored, with a lamp on top of the vehicles that
                   would signal when the trucks went too fast.

          (viii)   Emergency assistance at accident sites is not readily available in many DMCs.
                   Effective first aid and professional rescue services were reported only in
                   Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand.

          (ix)     Although road safety research is undertaken in all DMCs, sufficient funds are not
                   always available.


D.        Activities of ADB and Other Funding Agencies

10.     As of 1999, ADB had included road safety initiatives in over 30 projects in 15 DMCs.
Road safety activity, including technical inputs, rarely exceeded 2 percent of the total cost of the
projects. Recent projects (in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan) have allocated large
amounts (39 percent, 9 percent, and 5-6 percent of the loan amount, respectively [Appendix 3])
to road safety. The experiences of the World Bank and JBIC in the region were reported to be
similar to ADB's. Until recently, the projects funded by these agencies did not invest
substantially in road safety. After ADB TA 5620-REG, the World Bank established the Global
Road Safety Partnership (GRSP) and has been investing in many DMCs to help develop
national road safety action plans. ESCAP established a regional database on road safety, the
most significant among several activities on road safety undertaken with support of ADB TA
5620-REG. Subsequently, ESCAP published reports (Appendix 5).

11.      Safety audits were not undertaken in many projects funded by ADB, JBIC, or the World
Bank. While the externally funded projects improved the road surface, other inadequacies (such
as bends, poor alignment, and small communities straddling the road and intersections) were
not addressed. The end result has been that much higher speeds were possible, and more
accidents occurred (as seen in the PRC, India, and Thailand).l On a positive note, newer
projects have required safety audits and establishment of safety wings in highway authorities
prior to commissioning the road for traffic (Appendix 3).




l
    The absence of knowledge of the true monetary costs of accidents is a common problem in many DMCs.
    Additional research reflecting local conditions on accident costs and economic losses would be highly useful for
    policymakers and in raising public awareness. But these were not supported under externally funded projects
    (para. 50).

                       II.      ASSESSMENT OF ADB TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE


A.         Implementation Performance

12.    Design of the TAs. The objectives of TA 5620-REG were and remain highly relevant to
ADB operations in the road sector in all DMCs. Likewise, TA 2177-PRC and TA 2001-IND were
relevant to the immediate and short-term priorities in the road sector and ADB operations in the
PRC and India, respectively. The OEM reviewed the terms of reference (TORs) for the
consultants and found them clear in all TAs. The respective TORs were sufficient to enable
achievement of the intended outputs. The TORs were not modified; implementation
schedules were adjusted in TA 2001-IND due to delays in the loan effectiveness.

13.     The OEM reviewed the resources provided under these TAs, in terms of person-
months, skills mix for consulting services, and counterpart facilities (details on the evaluation of
inputs are presented in Appendix 1). TA 5620-REG was overambitious as regards impact in that
the main output, ADB's Guidelines on Road Safety were expected to be adopted, and an action
plan for five years was expected to be implemented, after one seminar in Bangkok. Except for
another seminar in Beijing, ADB did not formulate other activities. In fact in hindsight, the TA
should have included several annual follow-up events (under new TAs or ongoing ADB
projects). This need is echoed in the responses from the participants (para. 56). The TA
provided 20 person-months of international consulting services, which were effectively utilized.
In hindsight, domestic consultants should have been engaged additionally in many DMCs, to
collect data and to conduct national level discussions. The international consultants could have
been more effective, with the support of domestic consultants, in disseminating the ADB
Guidelines on Road Safety and the resolutions of the workshops.

14.     TA 2177-PRC was provided with adequate resources, in terms of consulting services.
The TA provided for 17 person-months of international consultants and 20 person-months of
overseas training and both these resources were fully utilized. The TA supported the review of
road safety in Heilongjiang Province, and the preparation of an action plan and a five-year
master plan (Phase I of the works). However, ADB did not provide additional resources to
implement the most urgent safety improvements or to implement the action plans in the two pilot
cities (Phase II of the works), but merely covenanted HPSB to implement these. In hindsight,
ADB should have provided additional support to HPSB.m Moreover, ongoing TAs reported that
the dissemination of the TA findings to other provinces could not take place immediately, due to
lack of resources. Additional ADB support would have been helpful.

15.     TA 2001-IND received limited input. The OEM observed that the eight person-months for
international consultants were insufficient. The consultants conducted one case study in
Karnataka state (actually there was no road section under Loan 1274-IND in this state), but
MOST has not actively disseminated the findings to other states. The international consultants
were assigned to assist MOST and selected public works departments (PWDs) to develop
accident analysis procedures and design low-cost remedial measures for highways. MOST
independently recruited a firm of domestic consultants to collect accident data for 18 types of
100-kilometer (km) stretches of national highway. The international consultants were also
tasked to assist the domestic consultants in establishing the methodology for black spot

m
    Considering the existing practice in the PRC, in which ADB lends to the expressway authorities through the Ministry
    of Finance and the provincial communication bureaus, ADB should consider innovative ways to support budget-
    dependent organizations like HPSB, which are responsible for road safety among other matters.
                                                            6


identification. As time and resources were insufficient, these tasks were not fully achieved
(para. 31).

16.    In TA 2177-PRC and TA 2001-IND, the participation of the recipient agencies in the
design (scope of activities, role of the counterpart staff, TORs for consultants, implementation
schedule) was effective. TA 5620-REG was also designed in close coordination with ESCAP,
the World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and other resource persons in
the seminar.

17.    Engagement of Consultants. The EAs (HPSB for TA 2177-PRC and MOST--later
National Highways Authority of India [NHAI]--for TA 2001-IND) were fully satisfied with the
engagement and services of the respective consultants. ADB, ESCAP, the World Bank, and
JICA were fully satisfied with the engagement of consultants for TA 5620-REG.

18.     Organization and Management. The OEM observed that the approaches and methods
adopted by the respective consultants were efficient in all three TAs. Likewise, the respective
EAs were actively involved in TA implementation. HPSB demonstrated full ownership of and
commitment to TA 2177-PRC. The EA reported a transfer of technology and knowledge from
the consultants. TA 5620-REG benefited ADB, ESCAP, and the World Bank substantially. The
World Bank developed GRSP.n In ADB, project officers followed up on TA 5620-REG and the
implementation of the ADB Guidelines on Road Safety under TAs and projects (Appendix 5
gives examples in the PRC and Thailand). However in India, TA 2001-IND was less effective in
that only the counterpart staff from NHAI, and the Karnataka police officials who worked with the
consultants, actively interacted with the consultants, and benefited from the TA's outputs and
services in their jobs.

19.     Implementation Schedule and Financing Arrangements. The three TAs had no major
problems with implementation schedules. TA 5620-REG started eight months late, and was
completed six months behind the original schedule. TA 2177-PRC was implemented according
to the original schedule. TA 2001-IND started eight months late, because the effectiveness of
Loan 1274-IND was delayed. The final report was submitted 12 months behind the original
schedule. This delay was due to delays in data collection and other activities by the domestic
consultants separately engaged by MOST. The international consultants required the database
for the accident analysis. The financing arrangements also followed the ADB Guidelines.
ADB fully contributed to TA 5620-REG.o TA 2001-IND and TA 2177-PRC were attached to ADB
loans. The governments contributed $15,000 and $200,000, respectively, to these TAs.

20.    Activities. The OEM reviewed the training, hardware, and software provided under each
TA. TA 5620-REG did not provide hardware or software to the DMCs. Over 110 officials from
more than 20 DMCsp participated in the workshop in Bangkok, Thailand and over 450 attended


n
     GRSP is a partnership of private sector, civil society, and government organizations dedicated to the sustainable
     reduction of road accidents, fatalities, and injuries in developing and transition countries. GRSP aims to identify
     innovative ways to improve road safety by applying the business partnership approach in selected countries. It
     hopes to produce solid evidence that partnerships between business, civil society, and government offer benefits
     for all three parties and that this approach can be widely used throughout the world. In this connection, GRSP is
     developing and implementing new demonstration projects with its partners in selected developing and transition
     countries.
o
    At appraisal, $600,000 was provided; another $60,000 was approved on 12 September 1997 for preparing manuals
     in Chinese. The actual amount was $643,904.
p
     The DMCs included Bangladesh, PRC, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua
     New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam.
                                                             7


the conference in Beijing, PRC.q The responses of the participants are summarized in Table
1. TA 2177-PRC provided training for 36 person-months. The consultants also provided
software for creating an accident database and conducting analysis of accidents. These were
well utilized by HPSB. TA 2001-IND provided on-the-job training to the Karnataka police and the
domestic consultants, and installed Microcomputer Accident Analysis Package (MAAP) software
in these offices. In addition, the consultants organized a seminar for 18 participants in October
1996 in New Delhi. The OEM observed that these inputs have been satisfactorily utilized and
the accident database has been expanded by the Karnataka police. However, there has been
no dissemination of this knowledge to other states, as originally envisaged (para. 15).

21.     Supervision. ADB supervision and guidance during implementation were fully
satisfactory in all TAs. Nevertheless, in TA 2177-PRC ADB has not followed up on the
implementation of the action plan.r In TA 5620-REG, ADB has not yet published the Guidelines
on Road Safety in Russian (as reported in the TA completion report) nor widely distributed the
Guidelines under ongoing projects.s In TA 2001-IND, ADB needs to pursue the dissemination of
the experience in the pilot programs to other states. In these follow-up activities, the OEM notes
that the ADB resident missions, particularly in the PRC and India, can usefully assist.


B.        Outputs and Sustainability of Impacts

22.     The major output of TA 2177-PRC was a final report which also included a
comprehensive highway safety action plan in two model towns, Datong and Jiamsui, in
Heilongjiang Province. TA 2001-IND produced two main outputs: (i) a final report on accident
data collection and identification of black spots, and (ii) a highway safety manual. TA 5620-REG
had four major outputs: (i) a final report that summarized the methodology used for data
collection, safety trends, and the major findings and conclusions; (ii) the ADB Guidelines on
Road Safety; (iii) a report on vulnerable road users; and (iv) RRSI.t

23.    Adequacy and Quality of Reports and Services Provided. The OEM reviewed all the
reports prepared by the consultants. The reports were well prepared in all the three TAs; they
were well written and the recommendations were clear. The EAs (in TA 2177-PRC and TA
2001-IND) were fully satisfied with the technical information and recommendations made by the
consultants. The OEM found that the ADB Guidelines prepared under TA 5620-REG were of
high quality and had been well received in all DMCs. RRSI proposed under the TA was
expanded by the World Bank as GRSP.u

q
    The Second Conference on Asian Road Safety (CARS2), jointly organized by the PRC Road Traffic Safety
    Association and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, on 28-31 October 1996, in Beijing,
    included a workshop titled "Asian Road Safety: Institutional Framework," and was attended by over 450
    participants, mainly from DMCs.
r
    Although the PCR reported that ADB and the EA agreed upon further actions to meet the unfulfilled covenants, the
    OEM observed that ADB failed to follow up on the EA's accomplishments. ADB projects divisions sent a
    confirmation letter after the project completion review mission but did not obtain information until the evaluation
    mission visited the PRC. Another institutional bottleneck in ADB is the lack of a facility to revisit completed projects
    (after the operations evaluation) to observe the operation and maintenance of facilities, and in this context the road
    safety in the road projects.
s
    The Russian translation was delayed because the resources for this activity were included under a TA grant
    attached to the loans for the Almaty­Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project, the approval of which was
    substantially delayed. It was eventually approved on 31 October 2000.
t
    RRSI identified priority actions that should be considered by DMCs, in a five-year term from 1997 to 2002, to
    improve road safety.
u
    ADB could have been more diligent in bringing in Japanese knowledge resources in its conduct of TA 5620-REG
    and sought closer cooperation with Japanese institutions such as JICA, JBIC, and International Association of
                                                        8



24.     Training and Technology Transfer. TA 2177-PRC and TA 2001-IND assisted the
respective EAs improve their capacities for improving road safety. In TA 2177-PRC concerned
officers from HPSB gained useful knowledge and applied them in their daily work. In India, the
Karnataka police fully utilized the skills received from TA 2001-IND and have been actively
involved in preparing "Road Safety Drive 2000" for the Bangalore Action Task Force (para. 30).
In many DMCs, participants positively responded regarding the knowledge gained in the
seminar under TA 5620-REG. Many apply the knowledge gained in their current work.

25.      Institution Building. TA 2177-PRC and TA 2001-IND generally achieved capacity
building in the respective EAs. However, in TA 2177-PRC, HPSB was expected to develop
capacity by implementing the action plan. Similarly, TA 2001-IND was limited in its impact only
to the Karnataka police. In both TAs, the wide dissemination of the TA outputs and training
activities, which was key to the capacity building, was overambitiously assumed, not
acknowledging the corresponding need for additional activities and resources.

26.     TA 5620-REG increased the awareness of DMCs on road safety. In the absence of any
follow-up activities (which were not present in the TA), the TA was unable to make a significant
impact on the capacities within DMCs to implement RRSI. Some countries like Fiji and Thailand
have been able to develop capacities through other externally funded projects, for example,
ADB projects (in Fiji) and ADB and World Bank projects (in Thailand).

27.    Performance of Consultants. The performance of consultants in the three TAs was
generally satisfactory. The OEM noted that they completed their assignments and delivered the
outputs in accordance with the respective TORs. The OEM confirmed the satisfactory
performance of all consultants from the back-to-office reports of ADB review missions and the
responses from EAs.


C.     Impact of TAs on Road Safety in DMCs

       1.       TA 2177-PRC

28.     TA 2177-PRC was successful in promoting various road safety measures in the
Heilongjiang expressway project and in general in the whole Heilongjiang Province. HPSB
confirmed that the action plans for the two model cities (Datong and Jiamsui) were useful as
pilot projects. The TA contributed to the substantial reduction in the number of
accidents/casualties along the highway and made a significant impact on the province-wide
road safety situation (Appendix 5). However, according to the project completion report (PCR),
HPSB did not take timely follow-up steps to meet the loan covenants. The OEM observed
though, that the EA has implemented various measures in a proactive manner showing
ownership for the TA's follow-up actions. Overall, the timing of TA 2177-PRC and the ongoing
TA 3341-PRC is very appropriate. The PRC is now accelerating efforts to complete 35,000 km
of national highway network.

29.   The OEM observed that safety audit and checking were not undertaken before the
commissioning of the Heilongjiang expressway project. It also inspected portions of the



 Traffic Safety Studies in its effort in revitalizing RRSI. In its renewed effort in restoring RRSI, ADB should work
 closely with ESCAP in emphasizing its regional focus.
                                                            9


expressway and provided feedback to HHEC.v HHEC agreed to incorporate such safety
concerns under an ongoing ADB project (Loan 1641-PRC).w

            2.      TA 2001-IND

30.      TA 2001-IND successfully helped the Karnataka police to establish a database on
accidents along national highways NH4 and NH7 using the MAAP software. The database has
been expanded to cover another 300 km of national highways in Karnataka. The Additional
Traffic Commissioner participated in the seminar in Bangkok (under TA 5620-REG) and
introduced the ADB Guidelines on Road Safety in Karnataka. The Karnataka police actively
participated in the Bangalore Agenda Task Force and launched the "Road Safety Drive 2000",
with support from the World Bank's GRSP (Appendix 5).

31.     The TA, however, was not successful in assisting the domestic consultants, in identifying
black spots using a statistically sound database and computer-based system. The data
collection suffered delays and the database was incomplete. Consequently, the computer
models prepared by the international consultants could not be calibrated reliably. The TA also
could not finish the pilot study for improving the capacities of the domestic consultants to carry
out a safety audit on the six road sections.x

32.    NHAI has been mandated to implement the National Highways Development Project
which entails widening to four lanes and strengthening of 12,000 km of roads within 10 years.
NHAI had completed only 509 km of four-laning as of April 1999. Along the 6,000 km of the
"Golden Quadrilateral" roads connecting Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta, and New Delhi, another
716 km are under implementation. The remaining 4,000 km are under preparation and are
expected to be completed by FY2008. The OEM reviewed road safety along roads in all three
categories. The roads reviewed were (i) completed roads with a total length of 111.13 km along
NH2 (Delhi--Mathura--Agra, with ADB, JBIC, and World Bank funding); (ii) 78 km of roads
under construction along NH5 (Vijayawada--Eluru, with ADB funding); and (iii) 19 km of
bypasses, bridges, and road improvements under implementation along NH45 (with NHAI
funding).

33.     The OEM observed that the completed roads are well constructed and generally in good
condition. The road surfaces in new construction are also of high quality. The designs have
followed the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) guidelines.y Nonetheless, road safety is a serious

v
    The technical observations include: (i) wire ropes were used for protective measures at roadside and median, but
    they did not seem to be strong enough for heavy vehicles, which accounted for most of the traffic volume; (ii) the
    length of guard rails at bridges was not enough to prevent vehicles from falling off; (iii) width of shoulders was too
    narrow, particularly at sections where protective guard ropes were installed; (iv) the ends of guard rail and rope
    sections were not properly tapered; (v) roadside drainage ditches were too close to carriage way and no barriers
    nor covers were installed to protect vehicles from falling; and (vi) guard rails or other protective measures were not
    installed at many piers of the bridges flying over the expressway that would prevent the collapse of flyovers and
    reduce damage to vehicles in a collision.

    Loan 1641-PRC: Changchun-Harbin Expressway: Hashuang Expressway, for $170 million, approved on 27 November
    1998.
x
    The domestic consultants misunderstood "safety audit" as a data collection activity at accident sites; the original
    objectives were not achieved. The international TA consultants could not evolve the low-cost engineering remedial
    measures for the worst sections, as the accident data collection and analysis were neither fully accomplished nor
    possible. The remedial measures were made for hypothetical cases. The highway safety manual was well
    prepared but it made little impact on potential users. The consultants distributed 75 copies within MOST and to
    other participants at the training course in New Delhi.
y
    The OEM separately met with IRC, which is a joint commission of various state level public works departments.
    IRC prepared another highway safety manual in 1999. It has conducted several seminars on road safety. The

concern in India along all national highways. The enforcement of traffic regulations is very poor
and the responsibility is divided among many district level police wings from different states for
various sections of one highway. There is no highway patrol. The roads do not have access
control. Especially in the rural areas, there are no underpasses for local village traffic. Education
for drivers and other road users is ineffective. Trucks and tractors are driven without the drivers
receiving any proper training in traffic rules. In many road sections, the OEM observed
unauthorized counter-flow traffic along the fast lane. Several fatal accidents happen every day.z
Roadside drainage has been constructed by NHAI but the state PWDs or municipalities have
not been maintaining it, as observed along NH45. Traffic signs and lane marking were lacking.
No lighting has been provided along highways in rural areas. In city areas where lighting has
been provided, it is not bright enough.

        3.       TA 5620-REG

34.     To evaluate the overall outcome and impact of this TA, the OEM conducted a survey of
the different stakeholders, i.e., participants, DMC governments, EAs, and other international
organizations.aa

35.     Participants from Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Philippines, and Thailand generally
found the workshop to be relevant not only to their own work but also to their respective
countries. Fifty percent of the participants who responded found the workshop to be well
organized, and of the appropriate duration. They also found seminar materials to be of high
quality. However, of the four countries, only Thailand reported major road safety activities
undertaken after the workshop; specifically, a committee on road safety and a road traffic
accident information system were set up, and a road safety master plan was developed.

36.    Fourteen respondentsbb believed that the ADB Guidelines on Road Safety were very
relevant to their work as well as to their respective countries. The report was of high quality and
a good reference source. In some DMCs, the Guidelines served as a basis for improving road
safety conditions. In Pakistan and Thailand, however, the Guidelines had limited use either
because of the lack of awareness of their existence due to the rapid changes at the decision-
making level, or because it was not translated into the local language (as it was translated into
Chinese in the PRC).

37.    To assess the impact of TA 5620-REG, the OEM classified the responses into three
categories, i.e., level of awareness, existence of road accident statistics, and the number of
actions taken. The existence of a national road safety center was used to indicate the
respondent's level of awareness of the importance of road safety. A rating of "A" was given
when a national center has been established and is fully functioning; "B", when the national
center has been established but not fully functioning; and "C", when the national center does not

   guidelines are not legal and IRC does not have any oversight function. Operation and maintenance and safety
   along national highways are major concerns for IRC.
z
   The Mission Leader had an accident along NH2 when a truck approached in the fast lane, but in the counter-flow
   direction. The OEM car swerved to the left (the slow lane) and collided with a bus, which had suddenly stopped
   without any signal (to drop off a passenger).
aa
   A questionnaire, which differed slightly depending on the targeted respondent, was sent to 68 persons
   (14 participants, 35 DMC governments, 16 EAs, and 3 international organizations). A total of 22 senior officials
   from 13 countries responded to the survey, 27 percent of whom were workshop participants. The responses were
   received from more than 50 percent of the DMC governments. EAs in PRC, India, and Thailand, JICA, ESCAP,
   and the World Bank also participated in this survey.
bb
   Although the Operations Evaluation Office (OEO) received 22 responses, only 16 gave an indication as to the
   relevance of the workshop.

exist. Under the second category, a rating of "A" was given when road accident statistics are
systematically collected and used for safety analysis purposes; "B", when the data system is still
being developed; and "C", when there is no road accident data system. The impact of the TA
was also assessed through the actions taken by the respondents. A rating of "A" is given when
many concrete actions have already been taken; "B", some concrete actions; and "C", few
concrete actions. Table 1 summarizes the ratings and classification of responses received from
22 senior officials representing 13 DMCs.

38.     Road safety awareness has improved as 12 out of 16cc respondents stated the
establishment of national road safety committees or centers. However, only in six DMCs are the
national centers functioning well. With regard to road safety statistics, only five respondents
stated that road accident statistics have substantially improved. Road accident statistics are
systematically collected and used in safety analysis according to these five respondents.
Nonetheless, an overall improvement in monitoring of road accidents could be expected as this
is gradually being systematized, with another six respondents stating that a system for
monitoring road accidents is being developed. The status of road accident data collection and
the bottlenecks affecting the implementation of actions are listed in Appendix 6. The activities
conducted under this TA have also resulted in other concrete actions being undertaken in ninedd
out of 13 countries. Although the number of actions in each DMC varied from just a few to
many, they included the formulation of a road safety master plan; fund-raising activities for road

accident victims and future road safety projects; identification of accident black spots and
corresponding countermeasures; and adoption of road safety measures such as improved road
and traffic signs, and safer facilities for crossing of pedestrians.


D.       Impact of TAs on ADB In-House Operations

39.     TA 5620-REG. At the workshop on preliminary findings on 11 September 2000, the
OEM confirmed that ADB management and staff recognize that road safety is an essential issue
to be addressed in all ADB-funded road projects. TA 5620-REG played an important role in
raising the awareness of the importance of road safety among ADB staff by holding several
seminars presented by the TA consultants. The ADB Guidelines on Road Safety were widely
distributed to ADB staff who are applying them for enhancing safety features in their road
projects.ee However, ADB has not publicized its policy on road safety yet and thus has not
further institutionalized its activities in this area. Also, a systematic approach for maintaining
proficiency in road safety among the ADB projects divisions is lacking due to frequent
movement of staff members.

40.     TA 2177-PRC. The TA impacted ADB operations in the PRC significantly. In the PRC,
all ADB-funded road projects approved since 1999 have had a road safety component.
Appendix 3 presents information on two of the more recent road projects in the country.ff In
particular, safety audits and checking at design and construction stages have been undertaken
in all recent road projects. Among other things, the ongoing TA 3341-PRC will specifically
undertake the wide dissemination of TA 2177-PRC findings in other provinces.

41.    TA 2001-IND. Loan 1274-IND is ongoing. The impact of the TA on ADB operations in
India has been minimal. The OEM made specific recommendations to address road safety
concerns in ongoing projects (paras. 58-60).


                                              III.     CONCLUSIONS


A.       Key Issues

42.      Engineering Aspects for Improving Road Safety. ADB staffgg acknowledged that road
safety is a design concern and has been given due attention only in recently prepared projects.
Consequently, several completed projects that did not require safety audits needed engineering
improvements (for example, curves, crash guards, etc.) to prevent accidents. The awareness of
the need for a safety audit aiming at accident prevention, by engineering improvements, is
lacking. ADB projects have generally concentrated on accident reduction by black spot
identification and engineering improvements. As demonstrated by the proactive measures by

ee
   Ongoing TA 3341-PRC will distribute Chinese versions of the ADB Guidelines on Road Safety during the training
   sessions, planned to take place from the first quarter of 2001.
ff
   For example, under Loan 1691-PRC: Southern Yunnan Road Development, an expert in traffic engineering is to
   (i) review the safety audit of the expressway design carried out by domestic consultants, and (ii) conduct a safety
   audit prior to the start of expressway operations. Under Loan 1701-PRC: Shanxi Road Development, an expert in
   traffic safety engineering is to (i) review the expressway design and facilities before opening, and (ii) provide advice
   on safe operations and assistance in establishing an accident statistics system.
gg
   The workshop on preliminary findings on 11 September 2000 was attended by Messrs. P. Giraud, J. Lacombe, and
   C. Melhuish. A note-to-file on the workshop has been prepared. The OEM also interviewed Messrs. Y. Ishikawa,
   M. Mizutani, P. Nielsen, R. Ostermiller, and P. Poinsignon.
                                                            14


the Land Transport Authority in Singapore, minor improvements such as no-swerve lanes and a
yellow rectangle at intersections, help significantly in preventing accidents.

43.     Enforcement of Traffic Rules. The traffic police, who are generally responsible in all
DMCs for managing traffic and enforcing traffic rules, have a bad reputation for their poor
accountability and ability to enforce rules. The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of
proper equipment for objectively monitoring speeding and other violations of traffic rules. In
addition, many police departments do not have a traffic-engineering cell to suggest
modifications on the engineering aspects, nor any budget to undertake the minor improvements
needed; this further limits their ability to enforce traffic rules (particularly in India).

44.     Along highways, proper collection of accident data and data analysis (accident
reconstruction and simulation) are not undertaken in many DMCs. Moreover, highway patrols do
not exist for many highways (including ADB projects) in India. The responsibility for a long
stretch of a road is divided among several police stations from different states, thus preventing
concerted efforts to enforce traffic rules.

45.     Education on Traffic Safety. Road safety education has been fairly ineffective in many
DMCs, except Fiji and Singapore. Driver education has not been strictly enforced (in India and
the Philippines) for truck drivers and tractor drivers. Road user education for pedestrians and for
villagers (using animal-drawn vehicles and farming vehicles) has been sparingly implemented in
all South Asian DMCs. Consequently, fatal accidents occur daily due to human errors--and
these are avoidable in many cases. In addition, in many rural areas, the roads do not have
proper enforcement of right-of-way and access control; roadside encroachment is prevalent;
roadside residents are not aware of the vulnerability to accidents, and open shops along road
shoulders, cross four-lane roads, etc.; some ride bicycles and farm vehicles against the traffic
flow. All these cause fatal accidents, which are totally avoidable. In urban areas, safety
education in schools, and safety campaigns in public areas and hospitals are lacking. The
nongovernment organizations could play an important role in such traffic education and
enforcement of traffic rules.hh


B.         Overall Assessment

46.     The summary evaluation of the TAs is given in Table 2. Details on the assessment of
input and outputs are in Appendix 7. TA 5620-REG is considered highly successful. The TA's
main output, the ADB Guidelines on Road Safety was a significant contribution. The Guidelines
could be widely utilized in ongoing and future ADB projects. TA 2177-PRC is also rated highly
successful. The TA developed action plans for two cities in Heilongjiang Province, which can be
effectively applied in other cities in the PRC. The impact and sustainability of the outputs could
be ensured under ongoing ADB TA 3341-PRC. TA 2001-IND is rated successful; Loan 1274-IND
is ongoing and the TA completion report has not been prepared yet.ii


hh
     In New Delhi, for example, the traffic police are focusing on safety education and traffic engineering. In 1999, the
     police established the "zero tolerance zones" for traffic safety. With support from nongovernment organizations,
     they monitor speeding cars using radar cameras. They have recruited more than 1,000 public and student
     volunteers, to report on traffic violations and to manage traffic at school zones, respectively.
ii
     The rating is contingent on implementing recommendations in paras. 58-60. The loan review mission reported that
     TA 2001-IND did not successfully achieve all objectives. NHAI was not proactive in implementing the
     recommendation (back-to-office report, 22 September 1999, page 3). The systematic black spot identification
     process could not be operationalized.

C.      Lessons Learned

47.    ADB's Guidelines on Road Safety and ESCAP's similar guidelines were timely
contributions to road safety initiatives in the DMCs. However, these two sets of guidelines need
to be used in all ongoing projects.

48.    The lack of safety education for drivers and road users is one of the main causes of road
accidents in many DMCs. In this regard, notwithstanding the impact of seminars and
consultants' reports under ADB TAs, an enormous need for systematically undertaking such
education remains.

49.     Concerned agencies in many DMCs lack the capacities and resources to undertake
systematic data collection and compile reliable statistics on accidents, road conditions, and
black spots.

50.      Another wider lesson identified in this evaluation is that road safety has not been
accorded the priority it deserves in various DMCs. The economic losses from road accidents
amount to 2-4 percent of GDP in many DMCs. Projects funded by multilateral development
institutions have not invested sufficiently in road safety. In the earlier ADB projects, road safety
activities amounted to less than 1 percent of total project costs. Safety audits have not been
systematically undertaken after completion of road designs and before commissioning of road
projects, mainly due to lack of awareness.


D.      Follow-Up Actions and Recommendations

51.     TA 2177-PRC. The PCR recommended a road safety improvement program and
advised HHEC and HPSB to implement the program by the end of December 2001. HHEC and
HPSB are advised to submit an update of the implementation as soon as possible. ADB
(Transport and Communications Division East [IETC]) is advised to monitor the implementation
of the program.

52.    Geometric design standards pertaining to safety features should be reviewed by ADB
(IETC) as soon as possible in ongoing expressway projects in the PRCjj with particular
emphasis on guard rails and roadside drainage ditches. Also, further actions should be taken in
introducing and disseminating good practice in safety audits and checking in these projects.

53.     ADB (IETC, in consultation with the PRC Resident Mission) is advised to formulate
further TA on road safety for the PRC by December 2001, to consolidate the experience of the
pilot action plans in the model cities in Heilongjiang Province and to facilitate its dissemination
on a nationwide basis, after incorporating lessons learned from the ongoing TA 3341-PRC.

54.     TA 5620-REG. ADB, for its part, recognizes that road safety is an essential issue to be
addressed in all ADB-funded road projects. Nonetheless, ADB should play a more active role in
its capacity as a member of the GRSP steering committee to emphasize the importance of the
public sector in improving road safety conditions in DMCs. It is most important to establish an
inter-agency authority or road safety council to coordinate the efforts of different government
agencies and the private sector for road safety.kk

55.     In parallel to this, ADB should seek the revitalization of RRSI for enhancing the
capabilities of DMC governments in coping with deteriorating road safety conditions due to very
rapid economic growth and associated modernization. Through this initiative and other
individual TAs, ADB should assist DMCs, together with ESCAP and other international and
bilateral aid organizations, in organizing regional seminars to share experiences among safety
experts from different countries through networking them, and in conducting national training
courses to increase the number of safety specialists in each country.ll Using ADB road safety
guidelines and outputs of ongoing TAsmm on road safety, effective training materials should be
developed and efficient schemes for conducting many training courses should be established
involving regional training institutions (such as the Asian Institute of Technology).

56.    The respondents in the survey for TA 5620-REG posed several recommendations
(Appendix 8), which the OEM found relevant for improving the impact of this TA. Table 3
presents the more common recommendations.




jj
   For example, Loan 1641-PRC: Changchun-Harbin Expressway: Hashuang Expressway.
kk
   The mechanism should also provide an annual budget to develop and implement road safety action plans in each
   country. Other aspects that need to be tackled on a priority basis are accident data systems and analysis, awareness
   raising, and capacity building.
ll
   ADB's Transport and Communications Division East is currently discussing the possibility of providing resources to
   undertake a regional road safety study of ASEAN through the ASEAN Secretariat which would support the
   Government of Japan's initiative of an annual seminar. The objective of the regional TA would be to prepare road
   safety action plans for each of the ASEAN countries and provide an adequate basis for further developing road safety
   through future ADB lending operations.
mm
          For example, TA 3341-PRC: Capacity Building in Traffic Safety, Planning and Management; TA 2850-FIJ:
   Road Sector Reform and Safety Improvement; TA 2152-SRI: Road Safety Study; and TA 2113-TON: Road Cost
   Recovery and Safety Strategies.

                                                                        Korea, Nepal, and Thailand
2.     Provide additional funding and technical                         Armenia, People's Republic of China, Fiji, India,
       assistance for road safety-related activities                    Lao PDR, Pakistan, Singapore, and Thailand
3.      Coordinate with DMC governments and other                       Fiji, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Pakistan,
        agencies related to road safety                                 Singapore, and Thailand
4.     Increase publicity and awareness of the                          Indonesia, Korea, Philippines, and Thailand
       recommendations of the TA as well as the
       importance of road safety by issuing
       newsletters, among others
5.      Increased dissemination of ADB Guidelines on                    Nepal and Thailand
        Road Safety and other reports produced under
        TA 5620-REG

  This follow-on workshop is aimed at (i) accelerating the process of establishing effective institutional arrangements in each of the
  DMCs, (ii) providing a venue for an effective exchange of ideas, (iii) updating the participants on road safety developments, and
  (iv) charting renewed direction for the challenges ahead.


57.     The respondents also proposed specific activities that need external funding and TAs.
These include: sponsoring an international road safety seminar in Singapore; providing
equipment, training, and short-term experts in the Lao PDR; and establishing a system of road
accident data collection, maintenance and analysis, and undertaking a safety audit of road
projects in India.

58.     TA 2001-IND. The OEM recommends implementing immediately the road safety
recommendations of TA 2001-IND, especially under Loan 1274-IND. ADB is advised to assist
and monitor MOST in this regard. For all ongoing and future projects, the OEM suggests
including all "safety measures" as a specific item and introducing an independent safety audit by
a road safety expert after construction. The OEM also recommends a review of the legislative
and regulatory framework for traffic enforcement. Future ADB missions for road sector projects
(for ongoing Loan 1274-IND and other projects) could invite the Office of the General Counsel to
participate to assist in this review.

59.     The OEM also suggested to NHAI to use loan savings under ongoing ADB road projects
for a safety campaign for at least one year for all newly constructed national highways. The
campaign could include highway patrolling, ambulance services, accident data collection, and
black spot identification and improvement. In the meeting with the OEM, JBIC (in New Delhi)
agreed to disseminate ADB's Guidelines on Road Safety in all ongoing and future JBIC projects.
JBIC also agreed to conduct a safety audit of completed roads and consider providing grant
assistance for improvements using the special assistance funds. The OEM advised NHAI to
write formally to JBIC requesting the safety audit and grant assistance.

60.   The Government wished to have a TA in FY2001 to review the road safety situation in
major cities and along major national highways. The TA would highlight problems and
recommend solutions which could be implemented with external funding; the TA could be
implemented using domestic consultants. The OEM fully supports this request.

61.     For ADB--General. ADB (Strategy and Policy Department) needs to devise a
mechanism for monitoring and ensuring the implementation of actions to be taken by EAs and
the compliance with unfulfilled covenants at the completion of TA and loan projects. It is
recommended that a small number of staff be assigned (at each projects division or at OEO)
who are responsible for monitoring EAs' implementation of actions agreed at the completion of
projects or TAs and for aptly advising EAs and relevant ADB staff to take necessary actions.
The same team should also be responsible for monitoring and advising the implementation of
actions recommended in operations evaluation reports.

62.    ADB should include a clear policy statement on road safety in its new road sector policy
paper that is being prepared.nn In addition, a more structured program of seminars and training
courses for ADB staff should be developed to familiarize them with and refresh them on various
aspects of road safety improvement and to disseminate good practices.

63.   ADB should prepare ADTAs on capacity building in road safety in all major DMCs, as
implemented in the PRC by TA 3341-PRC. The lessons learned from this evaluation and the
response from the participants (Table 3) support the justification for such ADTAs.

64.     Another general suggestion is for OEO to consider monitoring the sustainability of
selected completed projects and TAs financed by ADB at regular intervals, say in the third, fifth,
and seventh years after completion. (It could be called the "Sustainability Survey of Completed
Projects and TAs").oo In this regard, a special grant facility should be established for enhancing
the sustainability of completed projects and TAs. The facility may be utilized to mobilize
consultants for conducting an in-depth study of causes and recommend countermeasures to
solve the problems.pp The ADB resident missions can also usefully assist in these surveys
(para. 21).

65.     The National Safety Council of Singapore provided valuable inputs to TA 5620-REG,
especially in the preparation of the ADB Guidelines on Road Safety. The National Safety
Council would be an important resource center in the region for training DMC officials and EA
staff under ADB projects. ADB is advised to consider such training under ongoing and future
projects as soon as possible.qq Moreover, the traffic safety park in Singapore operated by the
Traffic Police provides mandatory practical lessons to primary-school children (about 500 a
day). Senior school children volunteer to manage traffic in the school zones. The park is

nn
   Internal guidelines are needed for operational reasons to indicate that management sees road safety as important
   and to assist staff to incorporate road safety into road projects. Staff would be happy to see a management
   directive stating that road safety should be incorporated in every road project as safety is often as much an issue
   as the environment, social, and other issues, which are incorporated as standard practice. At the present time staff
   guidelines for road safety audits are under preparation.
oo
   The sustainability survey may identify projects or TAs that are suffering from problems hindering the sustainability.
   Presently, these problems are often addressed in subsequent projects or TAs or ongoing ones if there are such.
   However, in cases where there are no such projects or TAs, or the problems require immediate attention, quick
   action is the key to ensure sustainability.
pp
   This could be highly useful for projects rated "less than successful" and "unsuccessful" during operations
   evaluation. JBIC has a similar grant facility, called Special Assistance for Project Sustainability (SAPS), that has
   been used with success for more than 10 years.
qq
   The Singapore-ADB Cooperation Facility (SACOP) could be used for this purpose.

supported by grants from many private companies. ADB is advised to review the experience in
Singapore and consider supporting the establishment of such safety parks in PRC, India,
Philippines, and Thailand as soon as possible.

                    FINDINGS OF THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK WORKSHOP1

A.         Impact of TA 5620-REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety2 on ADB Operations

1.      At the workshop on the preliminary findings on 11 September 2000, the Operations
Evaluation Mission (OEM) confirmed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) management and
staff recognize that road safety is an essential issue to be addressed in all ADB-financed road
projects. The consultants for technical assistance (TA) 5620-REG conducted several seminars
that raised the awareness of the importance of road safety among ADB staff. The ADB
Guidelines on Road Safety were widely distributed to ADB staff who are applying them for
enhancing safety features in their road projects. In particular, safety audit and checking at
design and construction stages are now undertaken in many ADB financed road projects (e.g.,
in the People's Republic of China [PRC] and Sri Lanka). However, ADB has not publicized its
policy on road safety yet and thus has not institutionalized its activities in this area. Also, a
systematic approach for maintaining the proficiency in road safety among ADB projects
divisions is lacking due to frequent movement of staff members.

2.      There is still a strong need in many developing member countries for training road safety
specialists and for developing and implementing their own road safety action plans, since road
safety is a complex and multifaceted problem requiring a comprehensive approach tailored to
the different conditions of each country.

3.      The Regional Road Safety Initiative proposal prepared under TA 5620-REG was taken
up by the World Bank that expanded the spatial coverage of the initiative to cover the whole
developing world and renamed it as the Global Road Safety Partnership. In this process, the
emphasis also shifted to the role of the private sector in road safety, although TA 5620-REG
concentrated on the institutional strengthening of government agencies and developing country
action plans, including a wide range of public-sector coordinated activities.

Specific Questions to ADB Staff Working in the Road Sector

1. What is the ratio of road projects that have                 Road safety is a major issue in road projects. At
   road safety components, and what percentage                  present, all road projects have a road safety
   of the project cost is devoted to road safety?               component. Specifically, in PRC, all of the road
                                                                projects have a road safety component, while in
                                                                Indonesia, road projects have a built-in safety
                                                                component. For a sector loan, the road safety

2. Are safety audits and safety checking required               Yes. This was introduced as a requirement during
   at the design and construction stages of road                negotiations with the Government and is done by
   projects?                                                    an international consultant at three stages of the

                                                                contributed to the increase in the level of
                                                                awareness on road safety.

                                                       Guidelines.
                                                       ADB should still continue its efforts in developing
                                                       road safety. Under a proposed regional TA, an

What actions have been taken on these consultants' recommendations "Actions Required by ADB
in its DMCs" in country/sector strategies?

1. Wide distribution of ADB Guidelines on Road          1. It depends on which country. For instance in
   Safety.                                                 Indonesia, the action plan is being revised after
                                                           the economic crisis. The ongoing project in this
                                                           country will monitor this. Transport staff have

          ONGOING INITIATIVES IN SELECTED DEVELOPING MEMBER COUNTRIES1

A.        Initiatives in India

          1.       Bangalore Agenda Task Force Perspective

1.     India has a major road accident problem with an estimated 80,000 people killed and at
least 400,000 injured in 1999. The responsible government agencies are making every effort to
reduce this carnage on the roads but they cannot do it alone. They need support from the public
and concerned private organizations.

2.      Bangalore has a serious road accident problem with hospital records indicating at least
800 deaths and 14,000 injuries every year. The majority of victims are young adults and the
most vulnerable are pedestrians and riders or passengers of two-wheelers. With the planned
growth of the city, action needs to be taken now to save Bangaloreans from this hidden and
silent epidemic that is predicted to be the world's third major killer by 2020.

3.      Bangalore has a proven leadership record with several initiatives promoted under the
Bangalore Forward Movement. This Movement is unique in that it is managed by a trisectoral
partnership of government, civil society, and the private sector under the Bangalore Agenda
Task Force (BATF). Its mission is to make Bangalore India's leading city and at par with the
world's best cities in five years. A key goal in driving Bangalore forward is to provide safe
mobility for all. To achieve this, the BATF has combined with the Global Road Safety
Partnership (GRSP) to launch its Road Safety Drive 2000. Substantial support is sought from
the technology giants and leading businesses of Bangalore. These agencies are committed to
sustainable growth of their industry and the successful development of Bangalore. With their
social responsibility and their management and resource capacity, their partnership with the
government and the citizens of Bangalore has tremendous potential to provide safe mobility for
all and achieve benefits for all the city's stakeholders.

4.       Global Road Safety Partnership. Good practices from GRSP projects will be
disseminated to influence the quality and quantity of road safety initiatives. Bangalore is the first
city to participate in this partnership approach to save precious human life. There are a number
of agencies already committed to GRSP activities around the world. These include Volvo, 3M,
DaimlerChrysler, Shell, Ford, Diageo, Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies, donor agencies, UN
organizations and others.

          2.        Traffic and Road Safety in Karnataka: Action Plan2

5.     Coordination. The Motor Vehicles Act (M.V. Act) contemplates the constitution of a
State Road Safety Council and District Road Safety Committees. This Council and these
Committees are in existence except for the newly formed districts of Karnataka State. There is a
need to revitalize these Committees to achieve coordinated thinking and action for reducing
road accidents.3

    The State Road Safety Council has not been able to meet regularly although efforts have been made. This will be
    ensured in the coming few months. It is also evident that the District Road Safety Committees are active in certain
    districts while not so active in other areas. It is expected that the Unit Officers may pay special attention towards
    this.
                                                   35                                 Appendix 5, page 2


6.      Information Systems. The Motor Vehicles Department has embarked on an ambitious
project to computerize vehicle and driver data for Karnataka, beginning with Bangalore City.
Computerization of accident data has been taken up in earnest using the Microcomputer
Accident Analysis Package (MAAP) in the state. In Bangalore City, it is an ongoing program; in
the Central Range, all the national highways have been covered and accident data is now
available for 1996, 1997, and 1998. This program will be spread to other ranges and districts in
the coming six months. A comprehensive Geographic Information System involving all these
elements such as vehicle/driver information, accident data, enforcement data, and information
on the physical aspects of the road network, etc. will be created for the entire State during this
year.

7.      Funding. The Government has been requested to provide additional budgetary
allocation for traffic improvement in Karnataka State as a whole and Bangalore City separately
for 1999-2000. It is also proposed to seek funding from externally funded projects such as the
Karnataka Integrated Health Systems Project (World Bank), Karnataka Urban Infrastructure
Project (ADB), etc.

8.      Education and Publicity. Comprehensive legislation is being prepared to form the
state, city, district, and taluk level organization structures for the Traffic Warden Organization
responsible for publicity and education on traffic safety in the state. It is also advisable to
emulate the Students Association for Road Safety, as it exists in Bangalore City, and involve
students in traffic safety campaigns/activities.

B.        Initiatives in Thailand

          1.      Thailand Global Road Safety Partnership

9.     To help address the mounting problem of road crashes in developing and transition
countries, the GRSP was launched in February 1999 under the umbrella of the World Bank's
"Business Partners for Development" program with the active participation of the Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) representing the road safety concerns in
the Asia-Pacific region. A related preliminary GRSP mission was undertaken in August 2000 to
explore the possibilities for establishing a Thailand GRSP program.

          2.      Thailand Road Safety Partnership (TRSP)

10.      Summary of First Roundtable Meeting Discussions on TRSP.4 Teams were
identified in only eleven road safety priority action areas as indicated below during this first
roundtable meeting. Other areas which were not discussed, as there were no interest groups,
and the same areas will be presented again in the second roundtable meeting.

D.        Initiatives at the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT): Capacity Building for Road
          Safety Improvement in the Developing Countries of the Asia-Pacific Region.5

12.      Road Safety Capacity Building through Training Programs. The training aims to
assist any person engaged in road safety activities on various aspects relating to road safety.
The training course would also provide an apt venue for technical experts and policymakers to
thoroughly discuss the key issues in the area. The program includes (i) development of
standard training modules in each identified area (to suit the developing country's
priorities), (ii) training of trainers on a subregional basis (for example, Greater Mekong
Subregion countries/South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation/Association of Southeast
Asian Nations regions), and (iii) nationwide workshops-cum-training programs.

13.     The Asian Center for Transportation Studies (Asian Institute of Technology) being a
regional center has adequate resources and expertise for conducting effective training in the
following important areas of road safety: (i) traffic police and law enforcement, (ii) driver training

systems, (vi) road accident costing, (vii) safe planning and design, (viii) vehicle safety
standards, and (ix) emergency assistance to road accident victims.

14.    The training courses will enable all stakeholders in the field of road safety to be properly
equipped, in terms of deep understanding and knowledge of the area, that would eventually
help them craft adequate responses to mitigate the risks faced by all road users.

15.    Tentative Topics/Course Outlines. The following areas comprise the training modules
on road safety: (i) traffic police and law enforcement, (ii) driver training and testing, (iii) road
safety education of children, (iv) road safety audit, (v) road accident data systems, (vi) road
accident costing, (vii) safe planning and design, (viii) vehicle safety standards, and (ix) emergency
assistance to road accident victims.

16.     Target Beneficiaries. Road authorities and road safety administrators, policymakers,
national road safety council, institutes dealing with road safety enforcement or driver training or
vehicle testing, and all road users, in general.

E.        Initiatives of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific

17.     According to ESCAP officials, TA 5620-REG contributed positively in increasing the
awareness regarding road safety among developing member countries (DMCs). After the
Bangkok seminar under TA 5620-REG, ESCAP published in 1997 seminar proceedings and
guidelines on road safety. The publications were widely circulated in the DMCs and were
reprinted in 1998. In 1999, the ESCAP Committee on Transport, Communications, Tourism and
Infrastructure Development suggested to the ESCAP secretariat to declare "a UN decade of
road safety." ESCAP is now an active participant along with ADB and the World Bank, in
preparing Thailand's national agenda under the GRSP. ESCAP is also actively supporting the
efforts of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and Japan's GRSP
committee for organizing country level seminars in many DMCs. Another area of interest for
ESCAP is to translate ADB's Guidelines on Road Safety in the local languages in various
DMCs. ESCAP also submitted proposals to establish a regional database on road safety6 and
an awareness program on road safety,7 seeking possible ADB funding.

          1.       Asia-Pacific Road Accident Database (APRAD)

18.    Objectives. The project aims to assist DMCs in improving road safety through the
development, establishment, and maintenance of a standardized and computerized regional
road safety database at ESCAP with an easy-to-use data storage, retrieval and analysis
system.

19.    Planned Activities. Year I (2001): (i) convert the existing statistics, compiled earlier
from 25 countries and available in a spreadsheet form, into a computerized relational database
using Microsoft Access database software; (ii) establish a computerized regional database at
ESCAP; (iii) develop a user-friendly analysis software package and a user manual; (iv) organize
a consultative meeting of representatives of relevant national agencies for approval of the draft
database format, analysis package, and data supply procedures; (v) identify national level
coordinating agencies for collecting data required for the regional database and disseminating
information.

20.   Year II: (i) expand the coverage of the database to other DMCs; (ii) update the
database, initially up to the years 1998/1999; and (iii) establish an ESCAP road safety website.

21.       Cost Estimate:             $150,000

          2.       Awareness Creation and Orchestration of Road Safety Improvement in the
                   Asia-Pacific Region

22.      Planned Activities. The project is planned in two phases, focusing initially on activities
at the regional level, to be complemented later by necessary national level actions. Proposed
activities for each phase are as follows:

          (i)      Phase I (1999-2001): Awareness creation to generate political commitment and
                   to lay the groundwork for road safety improvement in the region.
          (ii)     Phase II (2001-2004): Coordination and implementation of national road safety
                   action plans on a pilot basis.

23.     Cost Estimates. Phase I (1999-2001): $560,000; Phase II (2001­2004): $940,000;
Total: $1.5 million.

24.    Potential Follow-Up Activities. The results of the pilot road safety action plans need to
be reviewed and evaluated whether and how they can be transferred to other DMCs. The
national priority action plans will need to be followed up with five-year road safety programs
which in turn might require further external advice.

F.        Initiatives in the People's Republic of China8

25.      The ADB transportation safety TA 2177-PRC started on 15 October 1995, and was
completed on 31 July 1996. The Australian firm ARRB carried out the technical assistance with
its five experts coming to Heilongjiang. With the collaboration on the Heilongjiang Public
Security Bureau (HPSB), the consultants completed the report on the Heilongjiang provincial
road safety master plan. The report provided a detailed analysis on the road safety situation for
Heilongjiang Expressway Project (Loan 1324-PRC) and proposed a five-year plan. HPSB has
since strengthened the management efforts based on the experts' recommendations, and has
partially halted the increasing trend of road accidents. Below are the statistics for the
expressway.

1.      Awareness Education

(i)     Worked with media including radio, television, and print media to increase the
        dissemination efforts on the new State Road Safety Management Act, as well as
        major traffic accidents. They also held exhibitions on such road accidents.
(ii)    Worked with schools along the highway on road safety curriculum, and
        conducted the "Yellow Hat Program".
(iii)   Increased education efforts among villagers along the highway to increase their
        awareness.
(iv)    Printed and distributed information sheets to drivers.

2.      Addressing Key Bottlenecks

(i)     Specifically made an announcement that the safety belt rule will be rigorously
        enforced. Drivers and passengers must fasten their seatbelts, particularly for
        higher-class highways. Safety belts have been installed on all vehicles. This
        measure, it is believed, has contributed to decreased injuries and deaths caused
        by side friction (collisions) and tailgating.
(ii)    Over the last three years, 198 road safety-related signs have been set up.
(iii)   Increased 11 police patrol cars, 8-speed detector, one stationary radar speed
        detector, and video monitoring at four major exits in Harbin City.
(iv)    Completed and improved Road Safety Information Gathering System and
        provided 10 computers to traffic police branches along the expressway.

3.      Strengthening Preventive Measures

3.                    No answer.
4.                    Not much improvement. Efforts are being made to develop the database system within Ministry of
                      Transport and Communications (MOTC). Most executing agencies are still reluctant to cooperate with
                      the Database Center. To improve the accident statistics of the country, the cooperation of the National
                      Bureau Police, Ministry of Public Health, the Department of Highways, Department of Land Transport,
                      private voluntary organization and MOTC is needed.
5.                    MOTC lacks an accident database system. At present, accident data come from several sources such
                      as the local police station, Land Transport Department, and hospitals.

10.                   Pedestrians' death rates have dropped after numerous campaigns on pedestrian safety. Motorcycle
                      fatalities continue to be the highest as each year, around 100 motor cyclists and their pillion riders are
                      killed. Yearly motorcycle safety campaigns are held but the casualties are still about the same. Last
                      year, however, recorded the lowest number of fatal accidents--197 fatalities for all classes of road
                      users.
Malaysia
11.                   No answer.

12.                   Not improved. Road crash fatalities have risen sharply since 1991. In 1999, there were 362 deaths on
                      the roads, a 345 percent increase since 1991. Main factors contributing to road accidents include (i) poor
                      road condition, (ii) limited visibility at night, and (iii) increased number of vehicles on the road.
                      Between 1991and 1999, the number of vehicles increased by 134 percent. However in recent years,
                      there has been a slight improvement in the fatality rate and number of road accidents.
Pakistan
13.                   Road accident statistics have improved slightly but this is more due to the "Smead Principle" rather
                      than the result of implementation of RRSI and the Action Plan.
India
14.                   The accident rate and casualties are very high in India. Analysis of data on accidents in the country
                      revealed that the driver of the motor vehicle is the single major factor responsible for the accidents.
                      The driver's misjudgment or inattentiveness to the situation ahead could be due to his poor reflexes,
                      fatigue, inexperience, or being under the influence of intoxicants.
15.                   Road accident statistics have not improved.
Fiji
16.                   Road accident statistics have definitely improved: (i) reduction of fatalities from 111 in 1996 to 62 in
                      1999; (ii) annual decline in overall accident rate by 6 percent; and (iii) similar decline in serious injury,
                      minor injury, and damage-only accidents.
17.                   The number of road accidents in 2000 is somewhat lower compared to last year.

                     safety statistics, where a computerized system is used.
20.                  Road accident statistics have improved. A new type of computer database system and nationwide
                     network is being used.
Nepal
21.                  It is still too early for the efforts to herald national level impacts. However, a before-and-after study of

4.                   Use of the old form for accident reports. Some agencies claim that they use the existing
                     reports because (i) these legally and practically facilitate their responsibilities and official
                     duties, and (ii) of lack of personnel and financial support.
5.                   Lack of government support to solve problem of road accidents.

12.                  (i) Infrastructure. Road safety was not incorporated in earlier road/transport projects.
                         Thus, many unsafe roads had been built. During construction, safety measures and
                         safety instruments are not enhanced, which leads to several road accidents.

                     (ii) Institutional capability. The Lao National Road Safety Committee was established
                          in 1996. However, this Committee is not active. Also, cooperation among competent
                          authorities is not satisfactory. Enforcement of traffic regulations and
                          recommendations on road safety is not effective.

                     (iii) Financial sources. The shortage of funding is a major problem that delays and
                           stagnates road safety activities in the country. Funds are urgently needed for (i) policy
                           development, (ii) enforcement policy, (iii) capacity building, (iv) new infrastructure
                           and equipment, and (v) an education campaign.
Pakistan
13.                  (i) Lack of national organization to coordinate road safety activities among all relevant
                           agencies.
                     (ii) Lack of adequate finances.
                     (iii) Absence of institutional arrangement at the apex level in the highway agency.
                     (iv) Lack of qualified highway safety experts.

India
14.                  No answer.
15.                  Since the data on road accidents are basically collected and maintained by local police,
                     there is no institutional mechanism for its (i) transfer to highway authorities, and (ii) analysis to
                     plan countermeasures.

16.                 (i) Police enforcement programs need to be expanded.
                    (ii) Enforcement through the new Land Transport Authority is yet to be seen.
                    (iii) Government contribution toward road safety via various departmental budgets has to
                          be examined.
                    (iv) Publicity and awareness programs have to be expanded.

19.                  Most road accidents have taken place in low-grade highways, so the key factor to
                     reducing road accidents is the improvement of highway conditions.
20.                  Lack of awareness of the seriousness and urgency of the impact of road accidents on
                     the development of the local economy.
Nepal
21.                  Among the many bottlenecks, some of the important ones are: (i) human resource
                     development and retention of the trained manpower, (ii) frequent transfer of the
                     personnel in the relevant government agencies, (iii) inadequate budget allocation, and
                     (iv) lack of logistic support.

1-6.               Thailand        (i) High level coordination on road safety has to take place at various
                                   national and local committees.
                                   (ii) Additional funding and technical assistance (TA) are needed for the
                                   implementation of the recommendations of TA 5620-REG. This will
                                   complement the series of publications on road safety produced by the
                                   Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
                                   More publicity is also required.
                                   (iii) To increase the impact of TA 5620-REG, further TA, national
                                   seminars, and workshops could be undertaken in cooperation with
                                   executing agencies, academic institutions, and nongovernment
                                   organizations in Thailand. A more practical approach is important for the
                                   successful dissemination of technical information on the implementation
                                   of the measures.
                                   (iv) Continued access and communication among participants should be
                                   improved by using a mailing list or web pages. Also, dissemination of
                                   reports should be increased. The end users could easily access the
                                   reports if they are distributed to libraries and made available on the
                                   Internet.

7.                 Philippines     It is suggested that Asian Development Bank (ADB) distribute
                                   newsletters calling attention to the "Executive Summaries and the
                                   Priority Action Needed" which are apparently being neglected due to
                                   budgetary constraints, absence of a coordinating agency to manage
                                   road safety, or lack of appreciation of the seriousness of road safety
                                   problems in the country.

8.                 Korea,          To improve the impact of the seminar and TA 5620-REG, more publicity
                   Republic of     activities are necessary. Distributing newsletters and creating a regional
                                   body will be good measures to achieve these goals. Future workshops
                                   could be more successful if appropriate government officials are invited
                                   to attend, and they implement the resolutions after the workshops.

9.                 Indonesia       ADB could advise and support the Government to promote coordination
                                   because this is the weakest part in road safety management. It will be a
                                   good idea to set up a national road safety research council focusing on
                                   road safety data, role of police in driving license issuance and driver
                                   education, and vehicle testing. The council could organize workshops,
                                   distribute newsletters, and provide organizational support on road safety
                                   to other agencies.

10.                Singapore       (i) The traffic police has been strict in enforcing speed limits, drink-and-
                                   drive, no use of handphones, etc. However, many of the drivers and
                                   motorcyclists cut in from lane to lane. The National Safety Council of
                                   Singapore feels that this is a campaign that is long overdue.

                                     (ii) A road safety seminar is proposed for Singapore. Participants will
                                     come from Singapore and other countries in the region. The Ministry of
                                     Foreign Affairs has not yet approved this. ADB could consider
                                     supporting this seminar.

11.               Malaysia           It is suggested that ADB undertake an up-to-date accident cost study for
                                     selected countries in the region. This study will help authorities involved
                                     in road safety in bidding for a higher budget for road safety activities
                                     from their respective governments.

12.               Lao PDR            (i) The following road safety activities will be undertaken: (a) create a
                                     road accident data system; (b) issue a vehicle safety standard
                                     regulation; (c) issue guidelines on safety planning and design; (d)
                                     improve hazardous locations; (e) set up emergency assistance teams to
                                     assist road accident victims; (f) create a road safety research agency;
                                     (g) organize a responsible authority for funding of road safety activities;
                                     (h) initiate road accident costing; (i) improve driving skills by training
                                     drivers and introduce a graduated licensing scheme; (j) require the use
                                     of helmets for motorcycle riders and passengers; (k) strengthen the
                                     legislation, enforcement, and education of prohibiting driving while
                                     under the influence of alcohol; (l) control speed through enforcement
                                     and education; (m) improve traffic management; (n) enforce the use of
                                     seatbelts for front seat passengers and encourage it for back seat
                                     passengers; and (o) set up the Highway Police Department.

                                     (ii) ADB assistance could be in the form of financial support for
                                     equipment and training, or provision of short-term experts in these
                                     activities.

                                     (iii) ADB should closely cooperate with key organizations involved in
                                     road safety in each country and assist them regularly in the
                                     implementation of their action plans.

13.               Pakistan           (i) ADB should emphasize the development of institutional capability
                                     both at the national as well as the highway agency level.

                                     (ii) Highway safety improvements should be included in all future
                                     assistance in the road sector in Pakistan.

                                     (iii) ADB could include the ADB Guidelines in their country review and all
                                     review missions visiting Pakistan must touch on this.

                                     (iv) ADB should get the commitment of the Government to organize
                                     seminars in all major cities of the country to disseminate the contents of
                                     the ADB Guidelines.

                                     (v) Implementation of the ADB Guidelines could be made one of the
                                     covenants in all ADB-funded road projects in Pakistan.

                                     (vi) ADB TA grant could be provided as an incentive for the
                                     implementation of the Guidelines.

14-15.       India        (i) The mixed character of traffic in India (fast moving passenger cars to
                          slow-moving animal carts, hand carts, etc.) requires well thought-out
                          regulations and control measures to control the movement of vehicles,
                          drivers, other road users. ADB could assist in (a) undertaking legislative
                          and engineering measures, and (b) providing traffic control devices.

                          (ii) ADB may provide a regional TA to have a dialogue with developing
                          member countries (DMCs), and review the actions taken and draw up
                          further action plans.

                          (iii) Accident data systems, road user education, vehicle road-worthiness
                          inspection and provision of emergency medical services need to be
                          tackled more effectively. These require adequate coordination among
                          the different agencies involved and funds for various programs.
                          Dedicated teams with representatives from different agencies involved in
                          road safety need to be formed all over the region with dedicated funds
                          for organizing various road safety programs. These teams need to be
                          given the proper authority, responsibilities, facilities, incentives, etc. in
                          order to produce good results. ADB could assist through a TA in this
                          regard.

                          (iv) The lack of awareness among policy/decision makers has been a
                          constraint in treating road safety in a focused manner. ADB may
                          consider holding national seminars in each of the DMCs so that apart
                          from bringing out the awareness of this important issue, the process of
                          establishing effective institutional arrangements is also accelerated.

16-17.       Fiji         (i) ADB could initiate some traffic accident costing for the country.

                          (ii) As ADB has helped produce the Fiji Road Safety Action Plan II, Fiji
                          would need to have its implementation monitored and evaluated. ADB's
                          support through the availability of a Road Safety Adviser would be
                          preferred.

                          (iii) More consultations with ADB staff is required at the implementation
                          level to ensure that every agency involved in road safety (whether
                          directly or indirectly) is taken into account prior to each stage of the
                          program.

                          (iv) ADB should hold another seminar where DMCs could present
                          country papers on road safety developments since 1996 and discuss
                          further to chart new initiatives for road safety.

                          (v) People who are directly involved in operational matters should be
                          given the opportunity to visit other DMCs in the region to compare and
                          learn road safety programs. This will also enable them to develop
                          programs appropriate for Fiji that could be submitted to ADB for future
                          funding.

18-20.             PRC              (i) ADB can select one region to be financed and technology-aided.

                                    (ii) The following were pointed out in the Final Report of TA 3303-PRC
                                    and the Memorandum of Understanding reached between the
                                    Government and the ADB fact-finding mission for Loan 1701-PRC:
                                    (Shanxi Road Development) (a) improvement of road safety design,
                                    (b) installation of weighing equipment, (c) provision of a team of traffic
                                    police to carry out patrols, and (d) provision of two person-months of
                                    international consulting services for road safety and 12 person-months
                                    of overseas training.

                                    (iii) ADB can keep abreast with the latest developments in each country
                                    since TA 5620-REG through follow-up investigations.

21.                Nepal            (i) It is suggested that ADB (a) require road projects to address safety
                                    aspects (such as construction of footpath, safety barriers, improvement
                                    of road intersections, etc.); (b) require project consultants to work in
                                    close coordination with the Traffic Engineering and Safety Unit for road
                                    safety audits, accident and traffic analysis, and campaigns to create
                                    awareness among road users; (c) sponsor short-term training for
                                    professionals working exclusively on road safety; and (d) facilitate the
                                    exchange of professionals on road safety among the DMCs.

                                    (ii) For many people, it is not necessary to go through the whole of the
                                    ADB Guidelines on Road Safety. For instance, road engineers do not
                                    have much interest in the enforcement aspects of road safety. It would
                                    be much more useful if, based on the Guidelines, separate documents
                                    could be developed to cater to the needs of specific groups of
                                    professionals.

                                    (iii) In Nepal, road safety is still not part of the engineering education
                                    curriculum. If copies of the Guidelines could be sent to university
                                    libraries, the would-be engineers will have the chance to get acquainted
                                    with the subject matter.

                                    (iv) The Department of Roads, through its Traffic Engineering and Safety
                                    Unit, plans the following activities: (a) seminars on road safety for its
                                    engineers and the engineers from the consulting agencies, (b) seminars
                                    on road safety and traffic management with participants from other
                                    agencies, (c) develop guidelines and leaflets, (d) special training of
                                    traffic police personnel, (e) a road safety campaign, (f) develop a school
                                    level curriculum, (g) include accident rates as one of the planning and
                                    designing tools, (h) include in the contract documents road safety audit
                                    at various stages of the development of road systems, (i) execute
                                    demonstration construction works for accident reduction, and (j) strengthen
                                    the National Road Safety Committee.

22.                Armenia          ADB should (a) continue financing road safety programs, and (b) arrange
                                    a workshop twice a year.

             India       (i) The Government requested a TA for the year 2001 to review the road
                         safety situation in major cities and along major national highways. The TA
                         would highlight problems and present solutions that could be implemented
                         with external funding; domestic consultants could do this work. DEA also
                         requested additional copies of the ADB Guidelines on Road Safety.

                         (ii) In the rural areas, strict access control should be built in so that people
                         as well as animals will not enter nor cross the road. It is important to put
                         signs at least one kilometer before approaching the villages to expect
                         counterflow traffic. It is also important to put signs at least one kilometer
                         before every intersection or U-turn cut at the meridian to expect crossing
                         traffic. Similarly at intersections, blinking red lights are needed to caution
                         the through traffic to slow down. Wide publicity campaigns, community
                         education and information dissemination to highway drivers are urgently
                         needed. Accident spots should be marked and monitored regularly.

                         (iii) The Tamil Nadu state government wants to prepare a master plan on
                         road safety measures and seeks ADB assistance to improve road safety in
                         the state.

             Singapore   ADB could seek the Singapore Government's cooperation and grant
                         assistance (as in the training on water supply) to conduct regular training
                         for the project management unit officials in ongoing ADB road projects.
                         Future ADB TAs in the road sector could include similar capacity building
                         training for DMC officials. The training can be conducted at no additional
                         cost to the ADB project.
