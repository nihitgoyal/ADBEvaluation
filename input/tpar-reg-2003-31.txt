                                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

         Reforming pension systems across Asia assumed a greater significance and urgency for
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the wake of the economic and financial crisis that began
in 1997. In response to the crisis, ADB exerted concerted effort to strengthen financial market
institutions throughout Asia and to support activities intended to reduce the concentration of
assets held in weak banking systems. A core element of this strategy included technical
assistance (TA) grants intended to enlarge the role of pension funds in Asian capital markets.

        This technical assistance performance audit report (TPAR) covers five TA grants--
totaling $4.37 million 1 approved between November 1997 and December 1999--that were
intended to promote pension reform in (i) Bangladesh (TA 2915-BAN), (ii) Thailand (TA 2955-
THA), (iii) Indonesia (TA 3116-INO), (iv) Uzbekistan (TA 3134-UZB), and (v) India (TA 3367-
IND). These TAs were selected because they represent a broad range of ADB experience in
supporting pension reform across a number of dimensions, including the geographic distribution
of the countries involved, their level of economic and social development, the depth and breadth
of their capital markets, their institutional capacity, and the degree of aging in their underlying
populations. Two of the TAs --TA 2915-BAN and TA 2955-THA--were attached to capital
market development programs. The remainder were designed on a standalone basis.

         The rationale of these TAs was first and foremost to contribute to financial market
development. This is consistent with ADB's institutional approach to pension reform whereby it
has, thus far, been viewed primarily--if not exclusively--as a vehicle for increasing the flow of
long-term funds into the capital markets in order to promote greater market stability and provide
capital for investments of greater duration to support broader economic growth objectives. This
is reflected in their objectives, which broadly included the (i) designing of reforms intended to
heighten the role of privately managed pension schemes; (ii) development or strengthening of
the legal and regulatory framework, including the adoption of appropriate investment policies
and guidelines for funded pension schemes; (iii) auditing of the public pension funds; and
(iv) strengthening of operational procedures and the building of capacity on the part of market
regulators and participants (to improve the professionalism of fund management) and on the
part of counterparts (to improve their understanding of pension policy and options for reform).

         Promoting long-term domestic capital formation was consistent with ADB's country and
sector operational strategies, but the appropriateness of the designs of the TAs varied.
TA 2915-BAN was predicated on two fundamental assumptions, including (i) that the
recommendations of a prior TA had been accepted and that the Government was prepared to
implement them, and (ii) that the only barrier to increased capital flow was the inadequacy of the
regulatory structure and the inappropriateness of existing investment guidelines. Both
assumptions proved to be incorrect. The designs of the other TAs, while less fundamentally
flawed, still, in some cases, (i) overestimated the capacity of counterparts to fully appreciate the
policy issues underlying the reforms being proposed (TA 2955-THA); (ii) misjudged the degree
of political consensus surrounding the reforms the TAs were intended to implement (TA 2955-
THA, TA 3116-INO, and TA 3367-IND); or (iii) were overly ambitious (TA 3116-INO).

       Implementation of these TAs was completed between 7 and 12 months late, which
suggests their implementation schedules were moderately optimistic. However, implementation
was generally successful, and the delays themselves had no substantial impact on the
achievement of their objectives. The number of consultants used, their level of effort (in person-

months), and the division of labor between international and domestic consultants differed from
what was planned in most cases, but many of the differences were modest. Arrangements with
executing agencies were generally acceptable with the exception of TA 2915-BAN where there
was no effective counterpart. The quality of ADB oversight varied, ranging from exemplary (TA
3134-UZB--which demonstrated [i] the value of continuity in the management of a TA from its
design through its implementation, and [ii] the merits of counterpart engagement in TA design)
to very poor (TA 2915-BAN).

        The outputs and impacts of these TAs reflects the practical reality that pension reform is
one of the most controversial and politically charged public policy challenges facing any
government, whether in the developed or in the developing world. Pension reform requires
governments to balance competing social and practical interests and--like all programs of
insurance--changes in pension policy ultimately benefit some at the expense of others. Given
such political complexity, pension reform is typically a long-term endeavor that can take many
years, even if the political will exists to make changes rapidly. Against a realistic yardstick for
what these TAs could have accomplished, their impacts varied, ranging from virtually none (TA
2915-BAN) to substantial (TA 2955-THA--where a cabinet Committee for Retirement and Old
Age Policy was established and charged with the analysis of pension policy and the
development a reform platform). Several of the TAs, while falling short of the entirety of their
objectives, made important contributions in particular areas, including, for example, TA 3367-
IND, which created and guided momentum for the operational restructuring of India's provident
fund.

         The TAs covered by this TPAR are individually rated as follows: TA 2915-BAN--
unsuccessful; TA 3367-IND--partly successful; and TA 3116-INO, TA 2955-THA, and TA 3134-
UZB--successful. As a group, they are rated as successful. The evaluation criteria and ratings
used to support this assessment include (i) relevance: relevant (a higher rating would have been
assigned if the TAs had all been geared to the level of institutional development, needs, and
appetite for reform actually found on the ground); (ii) efficacy: less efficacious (which reflects the
fact that two of the TAs met only a portion of their objectives and one failed entirely to meet any
of its primary objectives); (iii) efficiency: efficient (which measures primarily the degree to which
schedules and cost targets were met, given the absence of performance measures);
(iv) sustainability: likely to be sustained (which reflects the inevitability of pension reform across
much of the region); and (v) impact: moderate (which reflects the practical reality that the
countries covered by this TPAR lacked the institutional capacity and political will to enact the
reforms along the timeframe these TAs envisaged).

         The key issues that emerged from this TPAR include the need for ADB to (i) revisit the
implicit--but flawed--assumption underlying all of these TAs that the use of pension reform as a
vehicle for promoting long-term domestic capital formation also represents appropriate social
policy, particularly for the most vulnerable groups in society; (ii) improve the skills and
knowledge of staff working on pension issues; (iii) improve cross-departmental coordination
between financial sector and human development staff during the design and implementation of
pension reform activities; and (iv) explicitly address distribution issues--particularly those
involving women and disadvantaged groups--in the design of any future pension reform
activities.

         The primary recommendation arising from this TPAR is that prior to launching any new
initiatives in support of pension reform, ADB should first develop an institutional framework for
pension reform that takes into account (i) the legal and regulatory preconditions for funded
pensions (this requires not only the existence of the institutions themselves but the presence of
                                                                                                vii


qualified regulators and an impartial and functioning judiciary to adjudicate claims); (ii) the
capital market preconditions for funded pensions (this requires not only sufficient market depth
and breadth to support portfolio diversification and secondary trading to support price formation
but also sufficient market absorption capacity such that pension funds have reasonable
assurance of being able to earn sufficiently positive real rates of return, net of administrative
expenses, to generate reasonable levels of income replacement for plan participants); (iii) the
fiscal constraints surrounding an increase in funding (reforms intended to eliminate pay-as-you-
go pension programs will necessarily increase costs in the short and medium terms because
some contributions are no longer available to pay benefits); and (iv) the distributional impacts of
different reform options on women and disadvantaged groups (which must be evaluated within
the context of ADB's mandate and commitment to poverty reduction). This framework should be
applied on a country-by-country basis to construct a more appropriately phased program of
pension reform, specific to each developing member country, that respects the constraints
identified above and is appropriate to the country's level of institutional development, human
capacity, and political appetite for reform.
                                            I.        INTRODUCTION

A.        Background

1.      Reforming pension systems1 across Asia assumed a greater significance and urgency
for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the wake of the economic and financial crisis that
began in 1997. 2 In response to the crisis, ADB exerted concerted effort to strengthen financial
market institutions throughout Asia and to support activities intended to reduce the
concentration of assets held in weak banking systems. A core element of this strategy included
technical assistance (TA) grants intended to enlarge the role of pension funds in Asian capital
markets.3

2.        The theoretical underpinnings of most pension reform initiatives launched by the
multilateral development banks over the past decade can be traced to a seminal World Bank
publication entitled "Averting the Old Age Crisis ."4 This study argues that financial security for
the aged, as well as economic development and growth, would be better served if governments
set as their long-term objective the establishment of three tiers, or "pillars", of old age security
including (i) a mandatory, tax financed, publicly managed pension scheme (the first pillar); (ii) a
mandatory, fully funded, privately managed pension fund or funds (the second pillar); and
(iii) voluntary, fully funded, privately managed pension funds (the third pillar). The first pillar is
intended to effect income redistribution--both across generations and from the comparatively
well off to the less well off within a given generation--in order to limit poverty among the aged.
The second pillar is mandated savings, the objective of which is to smooth consumption
between a person's working years and retirement. The third pillar is intended to provide a
means for persons to voluntarily save more during their working years than what is provided by
the mandated schemes. In combination, and if adequately managed and regulated, these three
pillars are expected to provide reasonable security against the risks inherent in aging. By
separating the redistribution function from the savings function, the public pillar--and the size of
the payroll tax needed to support it--can be kept relatively small, thus avoiding many of the
growth-inhibiting problems associated with large, pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) public pension
systems. The establishment of these three pillars remains the long-term objective of most
pension reform initiatives undertaken by the multilateral development banks. Considerable
debate exists, however, in terms of how this long-term objective should be implemented over
the short to medium terms across countries at different levels of economic and financial market
development facing varying degrees of demographic pressure.




1
    For the purposes of this report, the terms "pensions" and "pension systems" are used to describe (i) provident
    funds, (ii) other types of contractual saving schemes intended to provide retirement income, and (iii) pay-as-you-go
    public pension schemes.
2
    Prior to 1997, ADB provided only four technical assistance (TA) operations in support of pension reform. These
    include TA 1347-INO: Review of the Pension Fund Industry, for $85,000, approved on 3 August 1990; TA 1844-
    LAO: Pension Fund and Leasing Legislation, for $100,000, approved on 25 January 1993; TA 2033-BAN: Study in
    the Insurance Industry and Pension and Provident Fund Operations in Bangladesh, for $577,000, approved on
    27 December 1993; and TA 2138-TON: Pension Scheme for Civil Service, for $100,000, approved on 18 August
    1994. From 1997 until 2003, ADB provided 17 TA operations in support of pension reform. Summary information
    for these TAs is contained in Appendix 1.

    See the statement of the Vice President, dated 3 December 1998, from the 2-day conference on pension reforms
    at ADB Headquarters in Manila. This conference--which represented a major initiative by ADB to develop regional
    pension funds --was attended by delegates from over 22 countries.

3.     The following five TAs, totaling just under $4.4 million, were selected for this technical
assistance performance audit report (TPAR):5

         (i)      TA 2915-BAN: Insurance Industry and Pension and Provident Fund 6 Reforms;7
         (ii)     TA 2955-THA: Pension and Provident Funds Reform;8
         (iii)    TA 3116-INO: Reform of Pension and Provident Funds;9
         (iv)     TA 3134-UZB: Pension Reform;10 and
         (v)      TA 3367-IND: Reform of the Private Pension and Provident Funds System
                  Reform and the Employees' Provident Fund Organization.11

4.      These TAs --details of which are summarized in Appendix 2--were conducted in
remarkably different contexts, not only in terms of the financial constraints faced at the time the
TAs were designed and implemented (some of the countries were more affected than others by
the financial crisis that started in 1997) but also in terms of the pension systems already in
place, their level of economic development, and the underlying age structure of their
populations. The two Southeast Asian countries--Indonesia and Thailand--can be
characterized as rapidly modernizing countries. Several decades of economic gains have
resulted in declining rates of fertility, lower infant mortality, and greater longevity which will result
in the elderly constituting a larger share of the population and imposing greater long-term
pressure on systems intended to provide retirement income than is the case in Bangladesh or,
to a lesser extent, in India (see Figure 1 below).




5
   These TAs were selected to represent a broad range of ADB experience in supporting pension reform across a
   number of dimensions, including regional distribution, financial and socioeconomic development, and the aging of
   the country's underlying population (i.e., demographics).
6
   The term "provident fund" is commonly used to describe mandatory, fully funded defined contribution schemes
   managed by the public sector (second pillar institutions). In some places, a "provident" fund with outsourced private
   management of the investments is recommended as a way of reducing the wedge of high administrative costs
   created by having lots of funds competing for customers and running up huge marketing costs. The intent is to limit
   administrative costs while still benefiting from private investment management--both in terms of improving
   expected returns and in terms of making it more difficult for politicians to interfere with investment decisions in
   pursuit of legitimate or illegitimate ends. In some of these TAs, the provident funds are really voluntary employer-
   sponsored pension schemes (i.e., the third pillar institutions).

B.         Rationale and Concept

5.      All five TAs were intended first and foremost to support greater access by industry to
longer-term financing through capital market development. Two of the TAs--Bangladesh and
Thailand--were attached to capital market reform programs.12 Both were intended to promote
the establishment of a three-pillar pension system, the primary focus of which was heightening
the role of the second and third pillars to increase the flow of long-term capital into the capital
markets. This was to be accomplished by the development of a policy framework for pension
reform (in the case of Thailand) or the implementation of a policy framework developed under a
prior ADB TA (in the case of Bangladesh) as well as by the strengthening of the legal and
regulatory institutions overseeing contractual savings schemes, the elimination of tax
disincentives, and the relaxation of investment restrictions governing pension funds.

6.      The other three TAs --for Indonesia (TA 3116-INO), Uzbekistan (TA 3134-UZB), and
India (TA 3367-IND)--were not attached to capital market programs. Although still focused
largely on the objective of deepening the capital markets, these TAs did include components
directed toward first pillar or social safety net concerns. A component of TA 3116-INO, for
example, called for the audit of Jamsostek, Indonesia's provident fund for workers employed in
the private sector. Given the debilitating impact of the Asian crisis on the financial sector, the
financial health and sustainability of Jamsostek as well as private pension funds were of major
concern. A component of TA 3367-IND was intended to provide capacity building for the
Employees' Provident Fund Organization (EPFO), India's provident fund for workers employed
in the private sector. While the situation in Uzbekistan differed in several key respects--as a
country in the early stages of transition to a more market oriented economy and the only country
in the group with an established and effectively universal first pillar pension system--one
component of TA 3134-UZB was intended to help refine the existing system to make it

     20 November 1997. TA 2955-THA supported Loan 1600-THA: Financial Markets Reform Program, for $300 million,

financially sustainable over the long term, while others were intended to explore options for the
introduction of voluntary, fully funded private pension funds.

C.         Purpose and Scope

7.      These TAs shared the common objective of increasing the flow of long-term funds into
the capital markets to promote economic growth. They were intended to introduce (or
strengthen) the institutions and legal and regulatory infrastructure needed for fully funded
pension systems to operate successfully, including a regulatory agency, investment guidelines
and restrictions, and rules and regulations governing the activities of pension funds, investment
managers, and custodian banks. In addition, they were intended to develop the analytical and
theoretical capacity of those involved in the promulgation of pension policy. Appendix 3
summarizes the purposes, outputs, and expected outcomes for each of these TAs.

           1.      Bangladesh (TA 2915-BAN)

8.       This TA was predicated on the assumption that prior recommendations developed under
a previous TA13 had been accepted and would be implemented. As such, this TA was intended
to assist the Government to implement recommendations to create an enabling environment for
insurance products, pension funds, and provident funds through a two-pronged approach which
included (i) progressive liberalization and deregulation of these business sectors, and
(ii) strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory capacities of the oversight ministries. By
pursuing both objectives, this TA was intended to facilitate the flow of long-term funds to the
capital market and contribute to the market's development. The scope of the TA included three
components: (i) insurance sector reform (introduction of regulatory best practices, establishment
of prudential norms, and the design of a market surveillance system); (ii) pension and provident
funds reform (strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory structure, development of new
investment guidelines, and the preparation of a phased plan to shift from an unfunded pension
system to a fully funded system); and (iii) training for regulators and market participants from
both sectors.

           2.      Thailand (TA 2955-THA)

9.      This TA was part of a larger reform program intended to promote financial market
restructuring. By assisting the Government to promote the development of pension and
provident funds, the TA was intended to mobilize long-term savings and, at the same time,
strengthen mechanisms of social protection. Implicit in this approach was the presumption that
the goal of mobilizing savings would necessarily lead to improved retirement security. In
mobilizing long-term savings, the TA was intended to reduce the external resource gap,
strengthen capital market development, and secure investment-induced stable growth. The
scope of the TA included two components: (i) strengthening institutional foundations through
organizational restructuring, operations and procedures, and capacity building; and
(ii) enhancing the policy framework through the development of a pension and provident funds
master plan addressing legal-regulatory processes, incentive systems, and investment
guidelines.

     From the technical assistance completion report, "TA 2915-BAN, attached to the Capital Market Development
     Program loan, was designed to implement the insurance legal, regulatory, and organizational reforms
     recommended under TA 2033-BAN: Study of Insurance Industry and Pension and Provident Fund Operations in
     Bangladesh..."
                                                                                                                   5



           3.       Indonesia (TA 3116-INO)

10.      This TA was intended to (i) strengthen the financial sector by promoting the development
of the nonbank financial sector and alternative sources of long-term financing for investment,
and (ii) reduce poverty and improve social protection by promoting the development of partially
funded or fully funded pension schemes. The scope provided for two phases. In the first phase,
the scope required (i) the actuarial analysis of the financial sustainability of current and any
proposed pension schemes; (ii) an in-depth analysis of the impediments to the development of
employer pension funds and those sponsored by financial institutions; (iii) a feasibility analysis
of the restructuring of Jamsostek, the provident fund for private sector employees; and (iv) the
audit of existing pension schemes, supported by proposals for their restructuring. On the basis
of what was learned in the first phase, the second phase called for recommendations for
(i) increasing the level of social security coverage and mobilizing more resources; (ii) creating or
modifying investment policies, guidelines, regulations, and legislation; and (iii) operational
procedures to encourage the professional management of pension and provident funds in both
the public and private sectors.

           4.       Uzbekistan (TA 3134-UZB)

11.       This TA was intended to support the Government's pension reform agenda by (i) offering
recommendations for modernizing the administrative and financial management processes in
the current PAYGO system; and (ii) developing an enabling operational, legal, and regulatory
environment for the introduction of fully funded private pension funds. The scope included (i) a
review of the administrative and management processes and procedures of the existing public
pension fund; (ii) an independent external (international) financial audit of the fund; (iii) the
formulation of a sound legal and regulatory basis for the introduction of private pension funds;
(iv) the identification of the legal and regulatory measures needed in the capital markets to
support the introduction of private pension funds; (v) the identification of financial sector
preconditions to facilitate pension reform--including operational, legal, and regulatory conditions
within capital market institutions, insurance and asset management companies, and custodians,
etc.--and an analysis of the impact of the reform on the capital markets; (vi) detailed sector
studies to assess the feasibility of introducing private pension funds; (vii) an analysis of the
social dimensions of the pension reform, particularly with regard to private pension funds; and
(viii) the launch of a pilot project in Samarkand to improve data collection and processing.14

           5.       India (TA 3367-IND)

12.    This TA was intended to create a pension reform framework and to present practical
options, supported by cost analysis, for the structuring of a more efficient, equitable,
transparent, and sustainable private sector pension and provident funds system. The scope
included the (i) preparation of a study of both formal and informal mechanisms of retirement
income support, including the identification of long-term requirements for an adequate national
pension and provident fund system; (ii) crafting of recommendations for improving the legal,
regulatory, and tax frameworks governing the provident fund and private sector pension funds;


14
     The Samarkand pilot project was also supported by a World Bank TA, for $350,000, which funded the
     (i) preparation of an actuarial model to analyze the financial implications of pension reform options based on
     alternative economic and demographic scenarios, (ii) implementation of the Samarkand pilot project and the
     development of a management information system, and (iii) preparation of a campaign to educate the public on the
     proposed new pension system. The results of the actuarial modeling exercise were intended to provide background
     data and information for the design of pension reform to be supported by ADB's TA.
6


(iii) development of a strategy for modernizing the provident fund; and (iv) creation of a proposal
for the establishment of a pension research institute.

D.     Completion and Self-Evaluation

13.     Each of the TAs evaluated in this TPAR was evaluated by the operational department
responsible for it. Although TA 2915-BAN was covered as part of the program completion report
for Loan 1580-BAN(SF) (footnote 12), a separate technical assistance completion report
evaluated the TA as partly successful. TA 2955-THA was evaluated in a separate appendix as
part of the program completion report for Loan 1600-THA (footnote 12). This self-evaluation
rated the TA as successful. The remaining TAs --TA 3116-INO, TA 3134-UZB, and TA 3367-
IND--were self-evaluated on a standalone basis. All were rated as successful.

E.     Operations Evaluation

14.      An Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM) visited Indonesia and Thailand from 2 to 8 July
2003 and Bangladesh, India, and Uzbekistan from 19 August to 8 September 2003. The OEM
held discussions with a large number of institutions, market participants, TA executing agencies
(EAs), regulatory authorities, and other stakeholders. This TPAR is based on (i) a review of the
rationale, purpose, and expected outcomes of each TA; and (ii) an analysis of actual outcomes
and long-term objectives as revealed in discussions by the OEM. The OEM reviewed relevant
ADB records, analyzed pertinent data collected in the field, and supplemented this information
with follow-up discussions with ADB staff and additional research when needed. Special
attention was given to assessing the achievement of the stated objectives and outcomes of the
TA and the appropriateness of the underlying TA design. The implementation experiences of
the EAs for each of the TAs were also taken into account. The OEM evaluated the TAs in terms
of (i) the relevance of their design in relation to their underlying rationale and objectives, as well
as their consistency with the government's priorities for the sector and ADB's sector strategy; (ii)
the achievement of their design objectives; (iii) the efficiency of their implementation and the
adequacy of their outputs; and (iv) their actual outcomes and institutional and other
development impacts. The TAs have been rated individually (the evaluations are attached as
Appendixes 4­8) and as a group (see Section IV). For reasons explained below, the OEM
evaluations downgraded the self-evaluations for TA 2915-BAN (from partly successful to
unsuccessful) and TA 3116-INO (from successful to partly successful).

               II.      PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION PERFORMANCE

A.     Formulation and Design

       1.      Bangladesh (TA 2915-BAN)

15.      This TA was intended to promote the growth of the capital markets through the
liberalization and deregulation of the sector, together with the strengthening of the regulatory
and supervisory functions of the oversight ministries. The design of this TA was predicated on
the assumption that the recommendations of an earlier TA had been accepted and would be
implemented (para. 8). When the consultants arrived in Bangladesh, however, the Government
was not aware of the previous TA or its recommendations and was unprepared to implement
them. In addition, the design of TA 2915-BAN was flawed in that it was predicated on the
assumption that the only barrier to increased capital flow was the inadequacy of the regulatory
structure and the inappropriateness of regulatory guidelines. Since almost all of the provident
and pension funds currently operating in Bangladesh are unfunded (in the case of the
Government Pension Scheme and the Central Provident Fund for public sector employees,
                                                                                                  7


pensions are paid from general governmental revenues), simply relaxing the investment
guidelines to permit broader investment would have had limited impact on the supply of capital
for investment. The TA's stated objective and scope are silent on the contradiction between this
reality and the objective of promoting long-term capital flows. Moreover, the most pressing issue
facing the Government is not the need to liberalize and deregulate the insurance and pension
fund industries or to strengthen the regulatory capacities of the oversight ministries, but the
challenge of coping with a large and mounting pension payment liability. This issue--and the
need for a policy reform framework to address it--is not addressed in the TA paper, although
the task of evaluating the Government's unfunded liability is included as a major component of
the scope of work for the actuary. Finally, at the time the TA was launched, there was--and
there continues to be--no effective governmental counterpart for reforming the pension and
provident fund industry in Bangladesh. The issues facing these industries are quite different
than those facing the insurance industry, and the Ministry of Finance (MOF)--which served as
the EA for the overall Capital Market Development Program (CMDP)--had no jurisdiction over
(or interest in) the pension component of this TA. It is not apparent why the two sectors were
aggregated under the same TA design, and no coordination mechanism was established to
address this design flaw.

       2.      Thailand (TA 2955-THA)

16.      The design of this TA was predicated on the understanding that governmental
counterparts in Thailand--a relatively sophisticated, middle income country with a rapidly
developing economy--would have already been exposed to the principles and choices available
to them for reforming their pension system in line with recent international experience and
developments. In addition, the design of the TA presumed that the Government had already
made a commitment to the introduction of a three-pillar pension system, including the
establishment of a mandatory, fully funded, privately managed pension system (i.e., second
pillar). Both assumptions proved to be false. While it is true that Thailand's economy is
financially sophisticated, the institutionalization of formal pension systems and an appreciation
and understanding of them in the Thai culture was quite limited at the time the TA was
launched. Informal systems of old age security through extended family arrangements were still
very much the norm (although they were under considerable stress as a result of the financial
crisis that began in 1997). Even today, a large percentage of Thais still expect to live with and to
support their elderly parents. As a consequence, the expectations of the Government and the
consultants--based on their terms of reference (TOR)--were quite different. Given this, the
TA's design and desired outputs were more optimistic than was justified. Instead of
implementing a pension reform framework, the consultants first had to develop an
understanding among their counterparts of pension policy and theory, the choices for reform
available to them, and the cost and social implications of those reform choices. These tasks
were not envisioned under the original TOR, and the TA's design required significant
subsequent adjustment.

       3.      Indonesia (TA 3116-INO)

17.     The design of this TA was ambitious. Its TOR spanned two phases, totaling seven major
tasks, including opinion surveys, a full financial and actuarial analysis of the existing pension
schemes, a review of the legal framework, an actuarial and financial analysis of alternate reform
scenarios, a review of tax policy, the crafting of recommendations to recover pension losses
attributable to the financial crisis, the improvement of market oversight and the legal and
regulatory framework, the drafting of legislation and the creation of the institutional framework
for the proposed pension and provident fund system, the use of workshops to disseminate
results and recommendations and increase public understanding, and the preparation of a final
8


report. Even under ideal conditions, these tasks could not have been accomplished within the
proposed timeframe and budget of the TA. In addition, the design of the TA was flawed in that
there was one EA--the Director General of Financial Institutions in MOF--but the task of
implementation was handled by several other agencies including the Ministry of State-Owned
Enterprises, the Ministry of Manpower, and the Ministry of Defense. Coordination between these
implementing agencies was meant to take place through a high-level steering committee. In
practice, this approach proved to be ineffective, and the consultants were unable to access
much of the information they needed under the TOR and, ultimately, failed to gain consensus
and buy-in for their recommendations.

       4.      Uzbekistan (TA 3134-UZB)

18.     This TA had a limited scope that included providing support to the Government to
strengthen the existing PAYGO public pension system and to lay the foundations for the
introduction of voluntary private pensions. Its design benefited greatly from technical
discussions with the Government held before the TA design was finalized. Many of the tasks
under the TOR focused on diagnostic assessments, rather than the drafting of large roadmaps
for reforms that the Government would have been unlikely to adopt. In this sense, the design
was demand-driven, and it was the only TA among this group to have recorded its agreements
in the form of a memorandum of understanding co-signed by the Government. The design also
reflected a stronger emphasis on (i) social policy issues, including the alignment of contributions
and benefits, and the need to address gender disparities in retirement ages and service
requirements; and (ii) fiscal policy issues, including the need to separate pension fund
accumulations from the reserve funds of the Ministry of Social Maintenance (MSM). The design
included components intended to promote broader awareness of pension issues and help build
consensus for reform. This TA was designed in collaboration with the World Bank and
represents an effective example of inter-agency cooperation whereby the overall mission was
divided between the two institutions to take advantage of their comparative strengths and
available resources. The TORs for consulting services were well written and consistent with the
objectives of the TA design.

       5.      India (TA 3367-IND)

19.      This TA was designed to satisfy the Government's request for support for developing
sources of long-term capital for investment. In this sense, the design of the TA met the
Government's broad objectives. However, the design provided for a number of tasks--including
an analysis of both formal and informal mechanisms for providing retirement income support to
the elderly, recommendations for strengthening the legal, regulatory, and tax frameworks, and
the design of a pension research institute--that had little government support and no obvious
counterparts. India was not institutionally ready (or interested) in these components of the TA
and, as a result, the consultants were unable to effectively engage the Government on these
issues. Moreover, the decision to place the TA under the jurisdiction of the provident fund
(EPFO) effectively isolated the team from addressing broader issues of pension policy (although
it did improve the TA's effectiveness in addressing issues related to the strengthening of EPFO,
in some measure because of a management change at EPFO which created a renewed
demand for the TA's services).

B.     Achievement of Outputs

20.    The outputs from the TAs mainly comprised reports from consultants. These reports
provided recommendations for the (i) identification of reform options for publicly and privately
managed pension funds; (ii) development or strengthening of the legal and regulatory
                                                                                                  9


framework, including especially the adoption of appropriate investment policies and guidelines
for funded pension schemes; (iii) auditing of the public pension funds; and (iv) strengthening of
operational procedures and the building of capacity on the part of market regulators and
participants (to improve the professionalism of fund management) and on the part of
counterparts (to improve their understanding of pension policy and their options for reform)
(paras. 29­33).

C.      Engagement of Consultants

21.     All of the TAs were implemented through private consulting firms. In each case, the firms
and consultants were selected in accordance with the procedures established by ADB's
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The number of consultants used, their level of effort (in
person-months), and the division of labor between international and domestic consultants
differed from what was planned in most cases (Table 1), but many of the differences were
modest.

D.      Implementation

22.     Implementation of the TAs was completed, on average, about 11 months later than
originally planned (Table 2). However, these delays had little impact on the substance of TA
outputs. Arrangements with the EAs were generally acceptable, with the primary exception of
TA 2915-BAN (Appendix 4). While all of the TAs were designed to support capital market
development as their overarching goal, it is noteworthy that MOF was the EA in only two of the
countries--Indonesia and Thailand. Accordingly, these were the only two countries with
sufficient institutional development to adequately absorb the capital market development
10


contributions these TAs were intended to provide. 15 Support from the implementing agencies
was patchy. In the case of the three standalone TAs --all of which called for a financial
assessment or audit of the public pension system-- there was clear reluctance to provide
adequate access to information and data. In some cases, this forced delays in the
implementation of these TAs and caused tension between ADB consultants and governmental
counterparts.

                               period. Consultants started fieldwork

                               options. In 2002, two consultants provided       appropriate pension expertise.
                               legal and actuarial support to examine
                               reform options and their socioeconomic
                               implications.

                               information and data and counterpart
                               support for actuarial analyses of public
                               pension scheme, and (iii) insufficient time
                               allotted to accomplish an overly ambitious
                               scope of work.

                               a combination of factors including (i) an
                               overly optimistic schedule, (ii) delays in the
                               fielding of consultants, and (iii) bidding
                               difficulties during the procurement of
                               computer equipment for the Samarkand
                               Pilot Project (resolved only in late 2000).
3367-IND            12.0       Target completion date was not met due to        No effect
                               delays in conducting workshops with senior
                               Indian policy makers on the draft final
                               report. This was attributable in part to
                               constraints in the Government's schedule
                               and the resulting need for an extension to
                               give the Government time to (i) provide
                               comments on the draft final report, and
                               (ii) ensure that major issues were
                               addressed by all parties involved.

     The EAs for the other TAs were TA 2915-BAN--Ministry of Commerce, TA 3134-UZB--MSM, and TA 3367-IND--
     Ministry of Labor.
                                                                                                11



E.     Organization and Management

23.     The quality of administration of these TAs by ADB was inconsistent, ranging from
exemplary (in the case of TA 3134-UZB) to very poor (in the case of TA 2915-BAN). Only in one
case (TA 3134-UZB) was the TA administered by the staff who actually designed it. In most of
the other cases, TA supervision was weak overall--in large part because the staff involved had
limited technical expertise in the policy areas addressed by these TAs. The importance of
effective administration and management was well illustrated in the case of both TA 2955-THA
and TA 3116-INO where both TAs were floundering until new ADB staff--with sufficient
technical competence and commitment--assumed responsibility for their supervision. Without
these changes in oversight, both TAs would likely have been unsuccessful, wasting valuable
and scarce resources.

24.      TA 2915-BAN highlights the consequences of inadequate oversight. The absence of an
executing or implementing agency for pension policy was an early warning sign that there were
problems with the organization and management of the TA. As stated earlier, there was (and
continues to be) no effective governmental counterpart for pension reform in Bangladesh. Weak
government ownership, national strikes, TA staffing problems, and other factors made this TA
difficult to implement. Ineffective administration on ADB's part--five different ADB staff
supervised the TA over the period--failed to prevent an already difficult TA from failing.

25.     TA 2955-THA illuminates the importance of effective oversight. This TA was
implemented during the financial crisis that began in 1997--a very difficult period in Thailand--
and there were frequent personnel changes within the implementing agency (the Fiscal Policy
Office [FPO] of MOF), which resulted in the replacement of counterparts several times during
the course of the TA. In this case, oversight was the only thing that kept a difficult TA on track.
Sustained and concerted involvement on the part of ADB staff created and maintained
momentum for reform despite difficult circumstances. After replacing the initial mission leader,
there were no changes in leadership for the remainder of the 3-year period of the TA.

26.     TA 3116-INO underscores the difficulties faced in overcoming a major flaw in TA design.
Under this TA, the working group--headed by the Director General of Financial Institutions and
staffed by representatives from the Pensions Directorate, Ministry of Manpower, and Ministry of
Defense--intended to oversee the implementation of the TA was never active. This proved
highly detrimental to the implementation of this TA. Lack of coordination on issues of pension
policy contributed to the consultants' difficulties in accessing the information and data from the
various implementing agencies. Appeals by the consultants for ADB intervention went
unanswered until new ADB staff with the experience and technical expertise necessary to
effectively manage the TA were appointed to administer the TA toward the end of its life.

27.      TA 3134-UZB reinforces the importance of continuity between the design of a TA and its
implementation, as this was the only TA under which one staff member managed both
components. Despite this, developing the legal and regulatory base for voluntary supplemental
pensions was made difficult by reluctance on the part of the Government (a reluctance fueled, in
part, by concerns over the failure of pyramid schemes in the Russian Federation), and the task
of auditing the pension fund was made difficult by unwillingness on the part of the Government
to release the data. In response to these difficulties, ADB held three review missions and, under
a second memorandum of understanding, the Government reaffirmed its commitment and
clarified the purpose and intentions behind these components of the TA, thereby rebuilding
support for the TA on the part of MSM.
12


28.      TA 3367-IND demonstrates that effective management of a TA extends beyond the
oversight of consultants to include the management of counterpart relations. This TA was
languishing without government ownership or support until the provident fund (EPFO) took over
as the implementing agency. A price was paid for this move--being based in EPFO constrained
the team's ability to satisfy those tasks in its TOR outside what was of interest to EPFO--and
some of the consultants were unable to complete their anticipated level of effort because EPFO
did not need their expertise. That said, the work accomplished on behalf of EPFO was
appreciated, well received, and continues to guide and support EPFO's activities. In retrospect,
ADB could have been more responsive in its management of the TA by redirecting resources
earlier to support the activities of an agency that needed those resources without straying too
far from the spirit of the TA. As a result, some of the consultants were not effectively utilized,
and a mismatch emerged between the TORs and the needs on the ground.

                      III.      ACHIEVEMENT OF PURPOSE AND OUTCOMES

A.         Purpose

29.      The TAs were intended to strengthen market institutions and develop capacity among
market participants in order to promote the role of private pension schemes (i.e., the second
pillar) within the overall social insurance framework. Specifically, the TAs were intended to
(i) strengthen regulatory oversight through capacity building activities for market regulators, the
development of better operational procedures and information systems, the improvement of
regulations, and the relaxation of investment guidelines governing pension funds, investment
managers, and custodian banks; (ii) strengthen the analytical and theoretical capacity of those
involved in the promulgation of pension policy; and (iii) provide policy makers with specific
recommendations for reforms to accomplish the overarching objective of financial market
development.

           1.      Options for Reform

30.     Pension fund options were adequately addressed by most of the TAs.16 Under TA 2915-
BAN, the consultants recommended the establishment of a central provident fund. Their report
was thought by the Government to be too advanced for Bangladesh, despite being of
reasonably high quality. It may, however, play a role in the future as it provides (i) a policy and
practical framework for what is required to establish a central provident fund, (ii) a diagnosis of
where further TA might prove useful in pursuing this objective, and (iii) draft legislation to
support such a fund. Under TA 2955-THA, the consultants produced a collection of technical
studies that provided the most in-depth analysis of this type ever carried out in Thailand. These
studies provided important benchmarks whereby government officials can, in the future,
examine and evaluate options for reform. Under TA 3134-UZB, the consultants prepared the
basis for the legal and regulatory framework needed to support voluntary private pensions. This
framework addressed (i) critical thresholds, fund management, internal controls, and
governance procedures; (ii) the need for rigorous regulations to ensure investor confidence and
assure safe custody in a country where many people harbor a deep mistrust of financial markets
and banks; (iii) the design of a sound licensing and registration regime for institutions and
market participants; and (iv) the need for effective regulatory enforcement and audits. Under TA
3367-IND, the consultants provided a framework for pension reform, addressing such issues as
the reform design, legal and regulatory oversight, tax policy, possible modifications to current


16
     The focus of TA 3116-INO was to strengthen existing institutions rather than options for establishing a new
     framework for pensions.
                                                                                               13


investment guidelines, and expanding coverage. This report--prepared in the form of questions
and answers--was, however, of insufficient quality to satisfy the TOR.

       2.      Institutional Development

31.       TA recommendations for institutional development were most relevant for those
countries that already had those institutions already in place. Under TA 3116-INO, the findings
and recommendations of the consultants were presented in a report which included a financial
analysis of the current system; recommendations for legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms;
amendments to tax laws; a summary of the results of the stakeholder opinion survey; actuarial
analyses for selected scenarios to assess the liabilities of the mandatory programs; comparative
information on country pension programs and international best practices; and standards and
selected options for reform of mandatory programs. Under TA 3134-UZB, the consultants
prepared amendments to the law on state pensions intended to (i) align contributions and
benefits, (ii) address gender disparities in retirement ages and service requirements,
(iii) streamline early retirement provisions and social allowances, (iv) rationalize and minimize
exemptions from making payroll contributions to pension funds, (v) eliminate ad hoc decrees or
government resolutions which dilute the legal status of the pensions and result in frequent
changes in pension provisions, and (vi) separate pension fund from MSM's reserve funds and
the state budget in order to enhance accountability of pension funds.

       3.      Audits

32.     Accessing the data required to audit pension funds was difficult for all of the TAs. Under
TA 2915-BAN, the consultants were denied direct access to the data they needed but did
manage to conduct an actuarial analysis of the government pension system using limited data.
In doing so, they were able to at least estimate the size of the Government's unfunded liability
for paying benefits under the scheme. Their report presents in a very clear manner the
methodology followed, the assumptions used, and the various checks used to ensure the
assessment was analytically robust. In addition, their report provides possible approaches to
reduce the fiscal burden of the current system. Under TA 3116-INO, a valuation of the civil
service and the armed forces pension fund was completed and assessments were made as to
the fiscal sustainability of these systems. The consultants also analyzed the schemes under
possible future economic and demographic scenarios. However, the audit and evaluation of
other schemes--particularly Jamsostek--were never conducted because the consultants were
denied access to the data they needed (although they did provide extensive recommendations
using other sources, such as a Klynveld, Peat, Marwick, and Goerdeler [KPMG] assessment of
financial statements). Some of the key recommendations from this TA included (i) a full
independent audit of Jamsostek; (ii) reform measures for Jamsostek program to reduce costs
and increase contributions, adjust key system parameters (including replacement rates and
retirement ages), improve compliance and enforcement, and segregate funds; and (iii) improve
governance. Under TA 3134-UZB, the internal auditor of the government pension fund was
reluctant to provide the consultants access to pension fund accounts. Therefore, a financial
review and limited audit was conducted instead. This TA recommended that the government
pension fund (i) segregate pension and MSM accounts, (ii) adopt international accounting
standards and modernize accounts management, (iii) formulate guidelines for collections and
payments, (iv) conduct regular audits by external auditing firms, (v) strengthen risk analysis and
management capacity, and (vi) correct discrepancies between bank balances and reported cash
balances. Under TA 3367-IND, the financial position of EPFO was evaluated and a flexible
financial model was proposed to assess the viability and adequacy of the plan's design,
investment performance, auditing and accounting practices, and organizational structure.
14



       4.      Increase Awareness and Professionalism

33.      Most of the TAs satisfied those portions of the TORs intended to increase awareness
(both on the part of policy makers and the public) and improve professionalism (both on the part
of market regulators and market participants). Given obvious gaps in the understanding of local
officials and financial market professionals, the Thai Government and ADB agreed to a second
phase of implementation under TA 2955-THA. This second phase of activity focused on
informing Thailand's policy debate through public information campaigns, seminars, and
workshops intended to generate greater public understanding and awareness of pension reform
issues. Equally important, in this phase, the TA worked to resolve major differences of opinion
among stakeholders over the final structure of the proposed pension system. Two consultants
provided the legal and actuarial support needed to examine a number of reform options and
analyze their socioeconomic implications under a variety of scenarios. This represented an
important step toward building consensus. This second phase of activity also included the
preparation of a detailed, medium-term roadmap for a set of actions required to
operationalize a multi-pillared pension system in Thailand, as well as the drafts of enabling
legislation needed to initiate these reforms. Under TA 3134-UZB, reforms to the administration
and management of the pension funds were proposed involving the (i) introduction of formalized
strategic and business planning processes, (ii) introduction of a nationwide unique personal
identification number (PIN) system and the integration of social insurance contribution
collections with the tax collection process run by the State Tax Committee, and (iii) reduction of
the burden of data collection on enterprises by the streamlining of reporting and accounting
processes. As part of this TA, and with support from the World Bank, a seminar was held on
Administration of Pension Program Collections in February 2000 with participation from nine
countries.

B.     Outcomes

34.    Pension reform is one of the most controversial and politically charged public policy
challenges facing any government, whether in the developed or in the developing world. For
many persons, particularly those living in societies with weak banking systems and with
economies vulnerable to inflation, public pension systems often represent the primary (and often
the only viable) savings vehicle. Changes in benefits or in how income is redistributed within a
pension system can severely impact the welfare of the elderly in their retirement. For many
businesses, particularly those operating in countries with large informal economies, the size of
the social insurance levy represents a powerful incentive to underreport wages and hire workers
outside of formal labor arrangements. For many governments, social insurance contributions
represent a captive source of financing. As a consequence, pension reform requires
governments to balance competing social and practical interests and--like all programs of
insurance--changes in pension policy ultimately benefit some at the expense of others. Given
such political complexity, pension reform is typically a long-term endeavor that can take many
years, even if the political will exists to make changes rapidly.

35.      The challenge of pension reform is made more complex by the lack of consensus for
how it should be pursued. While most countries, in the long term, will ultimately adopt a pension
system based, at least in part, on the three-pillar paradigm--involving some minimal benefit (or
benefit guaranty) paid from payroll taxes or general revenues and intended to effect income
redistribution (the first pillar); some sort of mandatory contribution to a privately managed
pension scheme or schemes intended to force savings (the second pillar); and the option of
participating in voluntary private pension schemes for persons who wish to save more than what
is mandated (the third pillar)--there will inevitably be major differences in how this paradigm is
                                                                                                 15


applied worldwide. While there is general agreement that a multi-pillar system provides the best
diversification against the various types of risk faced by societies as their populations age, there
is less consensus on the question of how countries should make the transition from their
existing systems to this paradigm and, perhaps more importantly for institutions involved in
promoting such reforms, when countries should do so, particularly in the case of countries with
weak capital markets (which creates the risk that returns from second and third pillar pension
programs will be inadequate to assure reasonable levels of retirement income) or with very
young populations (such that there is little demographic pressure forcing change in the short to
medium terms).

36.     This question of phasing is, in the end, central to this TPAR but beyond its ability to
evaluate. All of these TAs presumed that the social policy objectives of providing income
protection to the elderly in their retirement would be best served by the introduction of reforms
intended to promote the second and third pillars of pension reform. Put another way, these TAs
presumed that increasing the supply of captive, long-term capital by promoting private pension
funds (or relaxing investment restrictions governing provident funds) would not only reduce the
concentration of assets held in weak banking systems but would also necessarily be in the long-
term interest of social policy.

37.      The intended outcomes of these TAs included (i) improvements in the coverage and
design of publicly and privately managed pension funds; (ii) institutional strengthening through
the introduction--or the amendment--of laws, rules, regulations, policies, and guidelines;
(iii) improved financial management by requiring the use of external auditors and the adoption of
international accounting standards; and (iv) improved operational procedures and greater
familiarity with and understanding of issues of pension policy. In the absence of readily
observable or measurable outcomes--the passage of laws or the creation of new institutions--
indicators of TA impact could include a government's use of TA reports or the establishment of
a working group or task force dedicated to discussing and ultimately acting upon issues raised
in a consultant's report. Based on the OEM's discussions and a review of activities under way,
the outcomes of these TAs clearly varied greatly across the countries involved. Even the level of
awareness of pension issues among policy makers varies greatly, making it difficult to support
sweeping statements about the outcomes of these TAs as a group.

       1.      Bangladesh (TA 2915-BAN)

38.    Of all of the TAs in this TPAR, the OEM found the least evidence to support positive
outcomes from TA 2915-BAN. From the outset, there appears to have been little appetite for the
pension reforms the TA was intended to support. Not surprisingly, therefore, those reforms have
not been adopted, nor was there much evidence to suggest that the recommendations made
under the TA are in the process of being considered. The outcomes of this TA were limited.

       2.      Thailand (TA 2955-THA)

39.     As a result of this TA--and continued involvement on the part of ADB staff--a cabinet
Committee for Retirement and Old Age Policy was established and charged with the systematic
analysis of pension issues and the development of options for reform. The minister of Finance
chairs this committee. The minister of Labor serves as deputy chair. A subcommittee for drafting
pension and provident fund reforms was formed and is headed by the director general of the
FPO. The pension framework proposed by the TA envisaged a multi-pillar pension system with
a second pillar (i.e., mandatory, defined contribution, privately managed pension funds). This
structure was hotly contested by a number of stakeholders. However, following TA-supported
public information activities and training sessions, preliminary proposals for a second pillar were
16


made in early 2000. Based on these preparations, the Government formally approved an action
plan for the introduction of the second pillar and authorized further work to determine its design
and the time frame for its implementation. The subcommittee--consisting of representatives of
stakeholders from the labor unions, regulatory agencies, employers, and the Government--has
been supported by ADB through further actuarial and policy analysis provided in 2001 and 2002
under this TA. This has resulted in proposals for an integrated pension system and a blueprint
for the phased introduction of the legal, regulatory, and administrative reforms needed to
implement the new system. During this time, the Government has been carrying out public
information campaigns to improve the public's knowledge and understanding of retirement and
savings issues. The increase in the general level of awareness on pension issues has been
significant.

           3.       Indonesia (TA 3116-INO)

40.      One of the major benefits of this TA was the ability to gather information on the impact of
the Asian financial crisis on private pension funds and other nonbanking financial sector
institutions. In the TA's TORs, it was simply assumed that pension funds incurred significant
losses as a result of the economic crisis. However, the consultants determined through an
analysis of private sector pension plans that assets grew disproportionately to plan liabilities and
that most pension plans consolidated their funding over the crisis period. This analysis revealed
the more important issue facing pension funds was whether the benefit formulas they used
would provide adequate income for plan participants in their retirement. Recommendations
provided under this TA provided useful input to the reform agenda for the pension sector in
Loan 1965-INO.17 In addition, the TA conducted a valuation of the civil service pension scheme
and, in doing so, raised concerns regarding its fiscal sustainability that are being pursued by the
Government. A full audit is being planned for the scheme, which has the endorsement of the
International Monetary Fund.

           4.       Uzbekistan (TA 3134-UZB)

41.     This TA was intended primarily to support the Government to explore the feasibility of
introducing private pension schemes and improve operations in the state pension fund. In this
sense, the TA was largely advisory. There were, however, some immediate outcomes.
Following a seminar on the Administration of Pension Program Collections, the Government
established an inter-ministerial committee, comprising MSM, MOF, and State Tax Committee to
expedite the establishment of a PIN system. The TA provided support for this activity until July
2000. At the time of the OEM, the Government had decided to implement the PIN system.
Moreover, the OEM found that some of the TA recommendations on the operations of the
pension fund are being implemented. MSM's reserve funds and those of the pension fund are
being segregated and fund bank and cash balances are being reconciled. One of the most
noteworthy outcomes of this TA is the pilot project in Samarkand Province to modernize social
insurance collections and the payment of pensions which has provided a vehicle for testing, on
a continuing basis, the effectiveness of new software and database programs. Productivity has
improved--four workers now do the work that eight workers did previously--and accuracy and
efficiency have also improved with fewer errors in payments and more timely updating of death
and new pensioner records. The pilot project has been so successful that the Government is
supporting its expansion to other districts in Uzbekistan.



17
     Reforms to the pension sector are affiliated in the second cluster of Loan 1965-INO: Financial Governance and
     Social Security Reform Program (Phase I). The first cluster was for $250 million, approved on 10 December 2002.
                                                                                                17



       5.      India (TA 3367-IND)

42.     Virtually all of the outcomes of this TA occurred at the provident fund. EPFO
management accepted and embraced many of the recommendations of the TA. Implementation
of these recommendations is under way, including financial and operational restructuring. EPFO
has contracted with a major software firm to support its operational changes by designing
systems software and pilot testing operational changes using the new software at six branch
offices. Simultaneously, training of EPFO staff is in progress. To enable relevant staff to operate
the system, 3,000 employees have been trained in the use of computers and an additional
5,000 are expected to undergo training by the end of 2001. Executive workshops have been
held for 450 managers in preparation for the restructuring, and their aptitudes for change have
been tested. While operational restructuring of EPFO is a task of considerable magnitude and
will take time, the clear vision and specific step-by-step processes recommended under the TA
greatly enhanced the chances of its success.

C.     Sustainability

43.     The sustainability of ADB's activities to promote pension reform depends almost entirely
on the political commitment of the governments involved, the effectiveness of these activities in
transferring knowledge and installing a sense of counterpart ownership over the reforms being
proposed, and the successful engagement of various stakeholder groups--including pensioners
and persons close to retirement, labor unions, and employers--in the policy dialogue. In
addition, sustainability is effected by (i) the institutional capacity of those involved in market
regulation and the promulgation of policy, and (ii) timing. The absence of demographic pressure
creates both a window for making less constrained decisions regarding pension system design
and reduces the political imperative for implementing reforms in the near term. In the long run,
pension reform is inevitable, given the inevitability of aging across the region. One additional
consideration is the capacity of the market to absorb funds from pension fund accumulations.
This requires a sufficient level of capital market development institutions and a supply of
financial market instruments appropriate for pension fund investment. Thailand has the capacity
and the political commitment to pursue difficult but necessary reforms, although staff turnover at
the FPO will certainly slow progress. Given the institutional capacity and ownership on the part
of counterparts, the process of pension reform in Indonesia, India, and Uzbekistan is likely to
continue, albeit at a far slower pace. With other more pressing concerns and very little
demographic pressure, Bangladesh will most likely require more time to initiate any real reforms
in the pension sector.

D.     Achievement of Other Development Impacts

44.      The broad goal of these TAs was to introduce (or strengthen) the institutions and legal
and regulatory infrastructure needed for fully funded pension systems to operate successfully.
While the quality of the reports produced by the consultants were generally acceptable, there
was little accomplished under these TAs in terms of actual reforms because they were mainly
advisory in nature. There were, however, some unforeseen outcomes. In Indonesia, the TORs
assumed that pension funds incurred significant losses as a result of the economic crisis that
began in 1997. The consultants determined, however, through financial analysis of private
sector pension plans that assets grew disproportionately to liabilities and that most pension
plans consolidated their funding during this period. In doing so, the consultants determined that
the more important issue was whether the benefit formulas used by these plans would be
sufficient to provide adequate retirement income to plan participants. Their analysis provided
useful information for the development of a reform program for the pension sector. In
18


Uzbekistan, an unforeseen outcome was the adoption of a PIN system for tracking pension
contributions and payments.

45.     In Thailand, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan and to a lesser extent India, TA findings and
recommendations were circulated and at least one workshop was held to review them. The
greatest socioeconomic impact of these TAs was felt in Thailand where the TA organized and
implemented a public information campaign, held seminars, and sponsored workshops to
educate and inform policy makers, stakeholders, and the general public. This work has been
relatively successful, as most Thais now understand the need for pension reform and appreciate
the options for reform. Conversely, in Uzbekistan--where most of the population was already
acquainted with the existing pension system--the bigger issue was balancing the financing
requirements of the current system with growing demographic pressure. The dialogue initiated
under the TA (which was still continuing during the OEM) was how to bring about reforms in a
prudent manner. The TA has had a narrow but profound effect on the understanding of policy
makers. The workshops in Indonesia and India had less impact, and the recommendations of
the TAs have not been fully absorbed by the Government or the broader population.

                             IV.      OVERALL ASSESSMENT

A.     Relevance

46.     All of the TAs were intended first and foremost to contribute to increasing the flow of
long-term capital into the capital markets in support of broader economic growth objectives. The
need for such funds in the wake of the Asian financial crisis is clear. Moreover, the financial
markets in all of these countries are underdeveloped and would benefit from an increased
supply of long-term capital, particularly when provided through the vehicle of institutional
investors, such as pension funds. Except in the case of Bangladesh, the reforms the TAs
supported would have progressed more slowly in the absence of ADB support. In this sense,
the four TAs were all highly relevant. Given varying levels of institutional development, however,
some of the TAs failed to adequately address the specific needs, capabilities, and appetites for
reform actually found on the ground. For this reason, the TAs are rated as a group as relevant.

B.     Efficacy

47.      The immediate outcome of these TAs in terms of promoting the implementation of actual
pension reforms or capital market development objectives varies considerably. The assistance
provided to Thailand, for example, has a high likelihood of achieving the policy goals
established under the TOR. In Uzbekistan, the TA effectively met its advisory goals by
(i) providing clear options and information for establishing private pension funds, (ii) helping
MSM improve the governance on the funds under its management, and (iii) supporting the pilot
project in using computer systems to improve the efficiency of operations in collections and
payments. These two TAs were highly efficacious. The assistance provided to India and
Indonesia, however, was less efficacious inasmuch as only some of the TA's intended
outcomes were actually achieved. The assistance provided to Bangladesh was inefficacious, as
it failed entirely to achieve its objectives. These TAs are rated as a group as less efficacious.

C.     Efficiency

48.     Given that pension reform is typically a long-term and politically-charged endeavor for
most countries, performance measures relating to the efficiency of outcomes could not be
reliably measured, although improved operational performance on the part of the state pension
fund was clearly evident in the case of the pilot project in Samarkand in Uzbekistan. The only
                                                                                                                       19


clearly inefficient use of inputs was found in the assistance provided to India where some of the
consultants were not effectively utilized given the mismatch between what was provided under
the TOR and the needs of EPFO. In terms of scheduling and successfully meeting cost
provision, none of the TAs was implemented within its original timetable, although all stayed
within their original budgetary provision. Given this, all of the TAs are rated as efficient except
India which is rated as less efficient.

D.         Sustainability

49.     The likely sustainability of the outcomes of these TAs varies. In Thailand, the level of the
Government's commitment--as evidenced by work already in progress--is clear, and this TA is
assessed as being highly sustainable. Several of the components of the other TAs are also
highly sustainable, including, for example, the restructuring of operations at EPFO in India and
the extension of the pilot project in Samarkand to other regions of Uzbekistan. Whether other
components of these TAs will be similarly sustainable is difficult to assess, particularly given that
many of their activities were advisory in nature. Given that the quality of the reports produced
under these TAs was, in most cases, very good, and given the contributions these TAs made to
the development of intellectual capacity among policy makers responsible for pension policy,
each of the TAs are assessed as providing benefits that are likely to be sustained, although the
benefits of Bangladesh as an individual TA are unlikely to be sustained.

E.         Institutional and Other Development Impacts

50.     The two TAs attached to larger reform CMDPs received little institutional benefit from the
programs they were intended to support. The most significant outcomes have been in Thailand.
This is at least in part attributable to (i) rapidly changing demographics (which has helped
generate an appreciation for the need for pension reform), and (ii) the fact that the pension
system was relatively underdeveloped compared to the rest of the economy. The outcomes of
specific TA components have, however, been substantial in the case of Indonesia, Uzbekistan,
and India.

                                               V.      CONCLUSIONS

A.         Key Issues

           1.        Promoting Long-Term Capital Flows is Not Necessarily Sufficient for Social
                     Policy

52.     ADB's involvement in pension reform has thus far been driven almost entirely by its
commitment to promoting capital market development under a fully funded voluntary pillar (i.e.,
the third pillar of social insurance) of the pension framework. In the countries covered by this
TPAR, pension reform was viewed primarily, if not exclusively, as a means of generating long-
term capital flows to support investment and fuel economic growth. The Asian financial crisis
underscores the importance of domestic capital formation--particularly long-term domestic
capital--in promoting stability within financial markets and in diversifying assets away from
weak banking systems. Given this, ADB's commitment to capital market development under
these TAs was relevant, targeted, and timely.

53.     The Asian financial crisis also underscores the importance of social safety nets in
reducing personal hardship in the wake of economic shocks. While the use of pension reform as
a vehicle for capital market development may, in the long run, broadly improve social welfare by
contributing to higher levels of economic growth, it does not necessarily represent good social
policy, particularly for the most vulnerable groups in society. Depending on how a reform is
designed, an increased emphasis on the second pillar of social security--and corresponding de-
emphasis on the first pillar--can reduce the degree of redistribution effected by a social
insurance system beyond what is required to effectively limit poverty among the aged, those
who become disabled during their working years, and the dependent survivors of persons who
die prematurely.

54.     Moreover, while capital market development might be an intended and positive
consequence of a pension reform that introduces a second or third pillar to a country's pension
system, the increased reliance on the capital markets to meet social objectives, concurrent with
a reduction in the role of the traditional first pillar of social insurance--a step typically required in
order to (i) finance transition costs,19 and (ii) keep a country's social levy from growing too high
and becoming a disincentive to the formalization of the economy--is not assured to meet those
social objectives. In countries with underdeveloped capital markets, particularly those vulnerable
to foreign capital flows and those in which there is political interference in the operation of
financial markets, there is considerable risk that real rates of return will be so low as to
undermine the capacity of private mechanisms of social insurance to provide adequate benefits
to program participants upon reaching their retirement.

           2.        Pension Reform Requires Cross-Departmental Teamwork

55.     While the introduction of voluntary private pension plans is an appropriate step in
financial market development and one that does not raise any serious social policy issues,

19
     In countries with an already established PAYGO public pension system, any step intended to increase the degree
     of funding in the system results in the diversion of contributions away from paying benefits to existing retirees.
     Because such benefits must be paid from somewhere, the current generation of workers is forced to pay twice--
     first for the benefits of those already retired or nearing retirement and second for themselves by making
     contributions to their own individual retirement accounts. Such costs are typically referred to as transition costs and
     while mechanisms exist for shifting these costs in part to future generations --through, for example, the issuance of
     government bonds --the fact remains that increasing funding within a pension system adds to cost of the program
     on a cash flow basis in the short to medium term.
                                                                                                  21


reforms that address mandatory systems of social insurance (i.e., first and second pillar
reforms) require the involvement of both financial sector staff and human development staff.
Given the interdependence of the first and second pillars--an interdependence created by
constraints on the size of the social levy and the inappropriateness of forcing more savings than
are required to reduce poverty among the aged--this means that neither pillar of social
insurance can be addressed without necessarily raising issues for the other. By implication,
while third pillar reform proposals can--and should--be managed solely by staff working on
financial sector issues, first pillar reform proposals require expertise in fiscal and social issues.
Mechanisms should be put into place to assure adequate cross-departmental jurisdiction over
first and second pillar policy issues.

       3.      Pension Reform Impacts Women in Ways that Merit Greater Attention

56.      The impact of aging on women merits special consideration and, up to this point, has
largely been ignored by ADB's activities in support of pension reform. On average, women live
longer than men. Most women marry men older than themselves and are less likely to remarry
after a divorce or the death of their spouse. Because of the responsibilities for child rearing and
the need to care for elderly parents, women are more likely than men to have shorter working
careers and to work intermittently. As a consequence, far more women than men fall into
poverty in their old age. Most public PAYGO pension systems (i.e., first pillar systems) generally
facilitate various forms of income transfer intended to help women and other vulnerable groups.
Fully funded defined contribution pension schemes, on the other hand, are enforced savings
schemes that, by design, do not effect such transfers, unless supported by minimum benefit
guarantees or other forms of income support. The impact of pension reform on women was not
adequately addressed by the TAs covered by this TPAR. For any future TA programs, the
impact of pension reform on women should be taken into explicit account if ADB is to avoid
contributing to proposals that leave women in its developing member countries worse off as a
consequence of its involvement.

       4.      Pension Reform Demands Knowledge and Skills Few Current ADB Staff
               Possess

57.      The conclusion to be drawn from these observations is that a one-dimensional approach
to pension reform--i.e., as a means for furthering capital market development without sufficient
regard and respect for social policy concerns--is inappropriate given ADB's mandate and
institutional commitment to poverty reduction. To the extent that ADB supports such reforms, it
must do so within the broader recognition that pension reform is necessarily an exercise in
social policy formation. Social policy concerns must be adequately addressed by pension
reforms, even if the primary objective of those reforms is financial. To address such issues, ADB
needs staff who understand them. A review of TA documents reveals frequent misuses of terms
and definitions, a lack of nuanced appreciation for different approaches to reform, and weak
designs that did not meet the needs or match the capabilities of TA counterparts or their
institutional agendas. The OEM discussions suggest that many ADB staff involved with these
TAs lacked the technical expertise and experience required to adequately engage their
counterparts on technical issues or supervise their consultants. As an institution, ADB requires
greater expertise in social policy issues if it is going to adequately support pension reform
initiatives on the part of its developing member countries.
22



B.         Lessons Learned

58.   The following lessons regarding ADB support for pension reform emerged from the
OEM's evaluation of these TAs:

           (i)      Continuity in the management of TA--from design through implementation--
                    greatly improves the likelihood that it will make lasting contributions and achieve
                    its desired outputs.
           (ii)     The design of TA must respect the specific needs, constraints, state of economic
                    development, and human and financial capacity of the country it is intended to
                    support. Overly ambitious designs for countries with low levels of institutional
                    development are bound to fall short of expectations.
           (iii)    The provision of TA in support of pension reform is most effective in cases where
                    the Government has expressed a strong appetite and commitment to the issue. It
                    absolutely requires strong counterparts to champion the issue in the political
                    arena.
           (iv)     The effectiveness of TA depends heavily on the quality and skills of ADB
                    management. The institution requires staff with better developed skills and
                    expertise in social policy issues in order to design and implement appropriate first
                    or second pillar pension reforms.

C.         Recommendations and Follow-Up Actions

59.     In order to adequately support pension reform in developing member countries, ADB
should invest in professional development to further the skills and understanding of pension-
related issues on the part of both human development and financial sector staff.

60.    Prior to launching any new initiatives in support of pension reform, ADB should first
develop an institutional framework for pension reform that takes into account:

           (i)      The legal and regulatory preconditions for funded pensions (this requires not only
                    the existence of the institutions themselves but the presence of qualified
                    regulators and an impartial and functioning judiciary to adjudicate claims).
           (ii)     The capital market preconditions for funded pension (this requires not only
                    sufficient market depth and breadth to support portfolio diversification and
                    secondary trading to support price formation but also sufficient market absorption
                    capacity such that pension funds have reasonable assurance of being able to
                    earn sufficiently positive real rates of return, net of administrative expenses, to
                    generate reasonable levels of income replacement for plan participants).
           (iii)    The fiscal constraints surrounding an increase in funding (reforms intended to
                    eliminate PAYGO pension programs will necessarily increase costs in the short
                    and medium terms because some contributions are no longer available to pay
                    benefits).20
           (iv)     The distributional impacts of different reform options on women and
                    disadvantaged groups (which must be evaluated within the context of ADB's
                    mandate and commitment to poverty reduction).



20
     It should be noted that borrowing to finance the cost of this transition effectively only makes explicit the debts
     already owed and, thus, contributes nothing to capital formation or aggregate savings.
                                                                                               23

                           EVALUATION OF TA 2915-BAN:
           INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND PENSION AND PROVIDENT FUND REFORMS

I.         Introduction

A.         Background

1.      Historically, growth in Bangladesh has been constrained by low levels of savings and
investment. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) 2033-BAN1
concluded that substantial reforms were required in the insurance and private pension fund
industries and in the provident funds if contractual savings institutions were to make a
meaningful contribution to domestic capital formation. To address this problem, ADB approved a
capital market development program (CMDP) in October 1997 to bolster investor confidence
with the objective of increasing savings and investment from the private sector. Under the
Program, policy measures were directed at strengthening market institutions and infrastructure
and promoting the role of contractual savings schemes. TA 2915-BAN2--attached to the
CMDP--was directed toward these objectives. In accordance with the agreement reached
between ADB and the Government during the early stages of implementation of this TA, the TA
was refocused on the provident funds and the private pension industry, rather than on the
insurance industry.

2.     At the time the TA was designed, the reach of pension funds was highly limited in
Bangladesh. Public sector employees were required to participate in the Government Pension
Scheme (GPS) or the Central Provident Fund (CPF). There were approximately
800,000 employees enrolled in this scheme that was excessively generous, providing
replacement rates (benefits expressed as a percentage of final salary) in excess of 95%.
Benefits were paid out of the Government's general revenues. GPS and CPF were regulated by
the pension and provident fund rules. There were no requirements for employers to establish
pension funds for their employees. Those private sector funds that did exist were regulated by
rules governing legal trusts. Most of the funds, including GPS and CPF, were operating on an
unfunded basis. Thus, they played no role in the capital markets. Even the funded private
pension schemes in existence played no role in the domestic capital markets because they
were required to invest exclusively in government saving certificates, government defense
saving certificates, or fixed-term bank deposits.

B.         Rationale and Concept

3.      Given the recognition that capital accumulating in pension schemes could provide a
source of longer-term financing for infrastructure projects and for capital investment, the
rationale of the TA was to strengthen the financial sector by promoting the development of
contractual savings schemes. It was intended to build upon the foundation created under TA
2033-BAN (footnote 1) by implementing the recommendations made by that earlier TA.

C.         Objective and Scope

4.    The TA was predicated on the assumption that prior recommendations developed under
TA 2033-BAN (footnote 1) had been accepted and would be implemented. As such, this TA was

1
     TA 2033-BAN: Study in the Insurance Industry and Pension and Provident Fund Operations in Bangladesh, for
     $577,000, approved on 27 December 1993.
2
     TA 2915-BAN: Insurance Industry and Pension and Provident Fund Reforms, for $500,000, approved on
     20 November 1997.
                                                                                             Appendix 4      29


intended to assist the Government to implement recommendations to create an enabling
environment for insurance products, pension funds, and provident funds through a two-pronged
approach which included (i) progressive liberalization and deregulation of these business
sectors, and (ii) strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory capacities of the oversight
ministries. By pursuing both objectives, this TA was intended to facilitate the flow of long-term
funds to the capital market and contribute to the market's development. The scope of the TA
included three components: (i) insurance sector reform (introduction of regulatory best
practices, establishment of prudential norms, and the design of a market surveillance system);
(ii) pension and provident fund reform (strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory
structure, development of new investment guidelines, and the preparation of a phased plan to
shift from an unfunded pension system to a fully funded system); and (iii) training for regulators
and market participants from both sectors.

D.        Evaluation

5.       The TA was evaluated by the operational department responsible for it. This self-
evaluation rated the TA as partly successful. An Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM) visited
Bangladesh in August 2003. The OEM held discussions with a large number of institutions,
market participants, TA executing agencies (EAs), regulatory authorities, and other
stakeholders. This evaluation is based on (i) a review of the rationale, purpose, and expected
outcomes of each TA; and (ii) an analysis of actual outcomes and impacts as revealed in
discussions by the OEM. The OEM reviewed relevant ADB records, analyzed pertinent data
collected in the field, and supplemented this information with follow-up discussions with ADB
staff and additional research when needed. The OEM evaluated the TA in terms of the
(i) relevance of its design in relation to its underlying rationale and objectives, as well as its
consistency with the Government's priorities for the sector and with ADB's sector strategy;
(ii) achievement of its design objectives; (iii) efficiency of its implementation; (iv) sustainability of
its contributions; and (v) magnitude and significance of its impacts.

II.       Assessment of Design and Scope

A.        Design

6.       The TA was intended to promote the growth of the capital markets through the
liberalization and deregulation of the sector, together with the strengthening of the regulatory
and supervisory functions of the oversight ministries. The design of the TA was predicated on
the assumption that the recommendations of an earlier TA (TA 2033-BAN) had been accepted
and would be implemented. 3 When the consultants arrived in Bangladesh, however, the
Government was not aware of the previous TA or its recommendations and was unprepared to
implement them.

7.      In addition, the design of this TA was flawed in that it was predicated on the assumption
that the only barrier to increased capital flow was the inadequacy of the regulatory structure and
the inappropriateness of regulatory guidelines. Since almost all of the provident and pension
funds currently operating in Bangladesh are unfunded (in the case of GPS and CPF--the
provident funds for public sector employees--pensions are paid from general governmental
revenues), simply relaxing the investment guidelines to permit broader investment would have
had limited impact on the supply of capital for investment. The TA's stated objective and scope

3
    From the TA completion report, "TA 2915-BAN, attached to the Capital Market Development Program loan, was
    designed to implement the insurance legal, regulatory, and organizational reforms recommended under TA 2033-
    BAN: Study in the Insurance Industry and Pension and Provident Fund Operations in Bangladesh..."
30     Appendix 4


are silent on the contradiction between this reality and the objective of promoting long-term
capital flows.

8.     Moreover, the most pressing issue facing the Government is not the need to liberalize
and deregulate the insurance and pension fund industries or to strengthen the regulatory
capacities of the oversight ministries. The most pressing issue is the challenge of coping with a
large and mounting pension payments liability. This issue--and the need for a policy reform
framework to address it--is not addressed in the TA paper although the task of evaluating the
Government's unfunded liability is included as a major component of the scope of work for the
actuary.

9.      Finally, at the time the TA was launched, there was--and there continues to be--no
effective governmental counterpart for reforming the pension and provident fund industry in
Bangladesh. The issues facing these industries are quite different than those facing the
insurance industry, and the Ministry of Finance--which served as the EA for the overall
CMDP--had no jurisdiction over (or interest in) the pension component of this TA. It is not
apparent why the two sectors were aggregated under the same TA design and no coordination
mechanism was established to address this design flaw.

B.     Engagement of Consultants

10.     The TA was implemented through a private consulting firm. The firm and its consultants
were selected in accordance with the procedures established by ADB's Guidelines on the Use
of Consultants. The number of international consultants actually used (four) and their actual
level of effort (13.2 person months) differed--but not substantially--from what was planned
(four consultants and 12.0 person months). Likewise, the number of domestic consultants
actually used (two) and their actual level of effort (7.3 person months) differed--but not
substantially--from what was planned (two consultants and 6.0 person months). International
consultants focused on TA objectives related to pension and provident fund reform and training,
while domestic consultants focused on objectives related to legal reform and training.

C.     Implementation and Cost

11.     The implementation of this TA deviated substantially from what was initially planned. The
TA was to have lasted for 6 months, closing in July 1998. In actuality, the Government did not
sign the TA agreement until August 1998. Consultants were not fielded until February 1999. The
TA was not completed until August 1999, over 1 year after the planned closing date. In part, this
delay was attributable to the fact that the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), the EA, and the
Department of Insurance (DOI), the implementing agency, were largely nonresponsive to the
concerns of the consultants.

12.    In addition, during TA inception, the Government determined that the regulatory and
organizational reforms for the insurance sector--which included improving the organization and
management of DOI--as recommended under TA 2033-BAN (footnote 1) would not be
implemented under the TA. As a result, the Government and ADB agreed to restructure the
work plan and to allocate more resources to pension issues.

13.   While allocating more resources to pension issues respected the Government's agenda,
as was noted in the TA report and TA completion report, the terms of reference (TOR) for this
TA were based on the assumption that recommendations from an earlier TA had been accepted
and would be implemented. While it was made clear that DOI was prepared to act on the
                                                                                   Appendix 4     31


insurance-related reforms recommended under the prior TA, this was not the case for the
pension and provident fund-related reforms. This caused confusion at the start of the TA. MOC,
in particular, was not fully aware of the recommendations made for pension and provident fund
reform under TA 2033-BAN and had no authority over any of the pension-related issues raised
in the TA report. This resulted in a difficult relationship with the TA consultants.

14.    The absence of an effective executing or implementing agency for pension policy was an
early warning sign that there were problems with the organization and management of the TA.
Weak government ownership, national strikes, TA staffing problems, and other factors added
substantially to these difficulties. Ineffective administration on ADB's part--five different staff
supervised the TA over the period--did little to help reduce the problems of an already difficult
TA to implement.

15.    The TA funds were almost all utilized. Only $17,000 was not disbursed.

III.   Achievement of Purpose and Outcomes

A.     Performance of Consultants and Quality of Reports

16.       In retrospect, given the implementation challenges identified above, it is not surprising
that the consultants were unable to access the information they needed in order to satisfy their
TORs. MOC showed little interest in the TA, as pension and provident funds fell outside its
jurisdiction. ADB was informed early of the consultants' concerns during TA implementation but
did little to address the problems the consultants were facing.

17.      The two most significant outputs of the TA included (i) actuarial analysis of the GPS, and
(ii) a proposal to establish a CPF. Although the consultants were denied direct access to all of
the data they needed, the actuarial analysis of the GPS enabled the consultants to estimate the
size of the Government's unfunded liability for paying benefits under the scheme. Their report
presents in a very clear manner the methodology followed, the assumptions used, and the
various checks used to ensure the assessment was analytically robust. In addition, their report
provides possible approaches to reduce the fiscal burden of the current system. Their second
report--which recommended the establishment of a CPF--despite being of reasonably high
quality was thought by the Government to be too advanced for Bangladesh. It may, however,
play a role in the future as it provides (i) a policy and practical framework for what is required to
establish a CPF, (ii) a diagnosis of where further TA might prove useful in pursuing this
objective, and (iii) draft legislation to support such a fund. Both reports were of acceptable
quality. The performance of the consultants was, on the whole, satisfactory.

B.     TA Outputs

18.     Inadequate communication between the consultants and the Government hampered the
dissemination of their findings and recommendations. The actuarial analysis of the GPS
revealed a ballooning fiscal burden of unfunded pension liabilities that could lead to a major
fiscal crisis in the future. Recommendations for addressing this looming crisis were suggested,
but they were neither embraced nor acted upon by the Government. Similarly, the proposed
CPF did not benefit from the input of stakeholders and, not surprisingly, did not ultimately obtain
their acceptance and support.
32     Appendix 4


C.     TA Outcomes

19.     In the absence of readily observable or measurable outcomes--the passage of laws or
the creation of new institutions--indicators of TA impact could include the Government's use of
TA reports or the establishment of a working group or task force dedicated to discussing and
ultimately acting upon issues raised in a consultant's report. The OEM found little evidence to
support positive outcomes from this TA. From the outset, there appears to have been little
appetite for the pension reforms the TA was intended to support. Not surprisingly, therefore,
those reforms have not been adopted, nor was there much evidence to suggest that the
recommendations made under the TA are in the process of being considered. The outcomes of
this TA were limited.

IV.    Overall Assessment

20.    The TA was less relevant than it should have been in terms of promoting reforms for
pension funds and provident funds. It was designed under the incorrect assumption that the
recommendations of the prior TA had been accepted and that the Government was prepared to
implement them. It was launched without an effective EA. It was inefficacious, as it failed to
achieve its objective of improving savings mobilization. It was less efficient by virtue of starting
late and closing over 2 years after it was supposed to have closed. Given weak ownership and
the absence of effective counterparts, there has been little institutional impact and no evidence
of sustained activity on the part of the Government in either the insurance or pension-related
sectors. This TA is rated as unsuccessful.

V.     Conclusions

A.     Key Issues

21.    The following issues emerged from the OEM: (i) there was no institutional assessment of
the merits of this TA or the Government's appetite for it prior to the initiation of the TA; (ii) the
foundation established by the prior TA was too weak to adequately support a TA designed to
implement its recommendations; (iii) the EA had no responsibility over--or authority to
champion--the reforms the TA was intended to promote; and (iv) the absence of ownership
over the TA on the part of the Government and the lack of institutional capacity to address
issues related to pension reform meant that this TA was implemented too early to be effective,
given Bangladesh's state of development.

B.     Lessons Learned

22.      Attaching a TA to a reform program will only contribute to the TA's success if its
objectives flow logically from the goals and objectives of the program. This was not the case for
this TA because almost all of the provident and pension funds currently operating in Bangladesh
are unfunded. Thus, relaxing their investment guidelines to permit broader investment would
have had limited impact on the supply of capital for investment and little impact on capital
market development. Moreover, pension reform is a politically charged activity involving very
different stakeholders than those involved with capital market development. For this reason, the
fit between the CMDP and the TA was poor, the appeal of the TA to the EA was limited, and the
institutional impact of the TA was negligible.

23.    Adequate administration and effective management is crucial to leveraging scarce TA
resources. At the outset of this TA, there were signs of weak government commitment. The TA
                                                                              Appendix 4   33


should have been cancelled after the almost 1 year delay in signing the TA paper. TAs that are
implemented in the absence of clear demand on the part of the Government run high risk of
falling short of expectations and may strain relationships to the point where future TAs and
programs are effected.

24.    Aggregating two different sectors under the same TA with different EAs is a poor design
decision unless mechanisms for coordination are agreed upon prior to the TA being
implemented.

25.     ADB needs to be more responsive to implementation concerns raised by its consultants
in the field. ADB staff could have provided better support and facilitated improved
communications between the consultants and the Government. The issues raised by the
consultants at the outset of the TA plagued the TA throughout its implementation and the fact
that they were never resolved contributed to the TA's limited impact.

C.     Follow-Up Actions and Recommendations

26.     Until the Government demonstrates a commitment to pursuing reforms in this sector, no
follow-up TA is recommended. The unfunded liability for pension benefits under the two
provident funds is serious and merits concern. ADB should engage the Government on this
issue, particularly given the fiscal implications involved in delaying reform.

                                   EVALUATION OF TA 2955-THA:
                              PENSION AND PROVIDENT FUNDS REFORM

I.         Introduction

A.         Background

1.      The Thai economy was in crisis in 1997. To address the crisis, the Government adopted
a comprehensive medium-term economic reform program with the support of various
international development agencies that included the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Three
issues in the Thai financial system were identified by ADB as meriting urgent attention and
reform: (i) nonperforming loans, (ii) financial market regulation, and (iii) insufficient national
savings. These issues were addressed under Loan 1600-THA. 1 Attached to Loan 1600-THA
(footnote 1) was technical assistance (TA) 2955-THA. 2 This TA was designed to address the
third issue of concern--increasing national savings through the further development of the
capital markets.

2.      Pension and provident funds first emerged approximately 5 years prior to the crisis.
Although the Social Security Act of 1990 set the stage for an expanded social insurance system
in Thailand (an expansion considered commensurate with Thailand's impressive gains in per
capita income), it was only with the movement of the Social Security Office to the Ministry of
Labor and Social Welfare in 1993 that it became institutionalized. At the time the TA was
designed, there were nearly 85,000 establishments covering almost 6 million workers registered
under the social security system, a mandatory pay-as-you-go (i.e., first pillar) public pension
system for employees working in businesses with 10 or more employees.

3.      Provident funds have a slightly longer history in Thailand. The Provident Fund Act was
passed in 1987. The necessary legal structure and regulations were issued in 1989. Under the
Act, contributions to provident funds come from employees and employers, subject to a
minimum contribution rate of 3% and a maximum contribution rate of 15%. Benefits are not
subject to taxation if they are paid after a person reaches the legal retirement age (or when
funds are rolled over from one provident fund to another), but are subject to taxation if taken in
cash. Provident funds are registered and regulated by the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) of the
Ministry of Finance. At the time the TA was designed and implemented, roughly
4,300 companies and just over 1 million employees were covered. In this context, it should be
noted the term provident fund refers to voluntary private pension schemes (i.e., a third pillar of
retirement income support) rather than to mandatory, fully funded defined contribution schemes
managed by the public sector, as the term is traditionally used.

B.         Rationale and Concept

4.      At the time the TA was being designed, it was apparent that a contributing factor to
Thailand's economic collapse was the asset-liability term mismatch within its financial sector.
Roughly 80% of domestic savings were being channeled into short-term financial instruments.
The need to develop longer-term sources of capital was seen as a necessary step toward
improving the resiliency of the financial system to external shocks. In addition, it was observed
that long-term capital could provide an important source for the financing of infrastructure and

longer-term investments. Expanding the role of funded pension schemes was seen as an ideal
vehicle for providing more stable longer-term sources of investment capital.

C.     Objective and Scope

5.      By assisting the Government in promoting the development of pension and provident
funds, the TA was intended to mobilize long-term savings and, at the same time, strengthen
mechanisms of social protection. Implicit in this approach was the presumption that the goal of
mobilizing savings would necessarily lead to improved retirement security. In mobilizing long-
term savings, the TA was intended to reduce the external resource gap, strengthen capital
market development, and secure investment-induced stable growth.

6.      The scope of the TA included two components: (i) strengthening institutional foundations
through organizational restructuring, operations and procedures, and capacity building; and
(ii) enhancing the policy framework through the development of a pension and provident funds
master plan addressing legal-regulatory processes, incentive systems, and investment
guidelines.

D.     Evaluation

7.       The TA was evaluated by the operational department responsible for it as part of the
program completion report for Loan 1600-THA (footnote 1). This self-evaluation rated the TA as
successful. An Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM) visited Thailand in July 2003. The OEM
held discussions with a large number of institutions, market participants, the executing agency,
regulatory authorities, and other stakeholders. This evaluation is based on (i) a review of the
rationale, purpose, and expected outcomes of each TA; and (ii) an analysis of actual outcomes
and impacts as revealed in discussions by the OEM. The OEM reviewed relevant ADB records,
analyzed pertinent data collected in the field, and supplemented this information with follow-up
discussions with ADB staff and additional research when needed. The OEM evaluated the TA in
terms of (i) the relevance of its design in relation to its underlying rationale and objectives, as
well as its consistency with the Government's priorities for the sector and with ADB's sector
strategy; (ii) the achievement of its design objectives; (iii) the efficiency of its implementation;
(iv) the sustainability of its contributions; and (v) the magnitude and significance of its impacts.

II.    Assessment of Design and Scope

A.     Design

8.       The design of this TA was predicated on the understanding that governmental
counterparts in Thailand--a relatively sophisticated, middle income country with a rapidly
developing economy--would have already been exposed to the principles and choices available
to them for reforming their pension system in line with recent international experience and
developments. In addition, the design of the TA presumed that the Government had already
made a commitment to the introduction of a three-pillar pension system, including the
establishment of a mandatory, fully funded, privately managed pension system (i.e., second
pillar).

9.      Both assumptions proved to be false. While it is true that Thailand's economy is
financially sophisticated, the institutionalization of formal pension systems and an appreciation
and understanding of them in the Thai culture was quite limited at the time the TA was
launched. Informal systems of old age security through extended family arrangements were still
36     Appendix 5



very much the norm (although they were under considerable stress as a result of the financial
crisis that began in 1997). Even today, a large percentage of Thais still expect to live with and to
support their elderly parents. As a consequence, the expectations of the Government and the
consultants--based on their terms of reference (TOR)--were quite different.

10.      Given this fact, the TA's design and desired outputs were more optimistic than was
justified. Instead of implementing a pension reform framework, the consultants first had to
develop an understanding among their counterparts of pension policy and theory, the reform
choices available to them, and the cost and social implications of those choices. These tasks
were not envisioned under the original TOR, and the TA's design required significant
subsequent adjustment.

11.     Diligence on the part of ADB staff administering this TA promoted constructive dialogue
with the Government and the TA consultants on these design flaws. The original design was
subsequently modified and additional support was provided under the TA to address those
issues that were not adequately addressed by the original design.

B.     Engagement of Consultants

12.      The TA was implemented through a private consulting firm. The firm and its consultants
were selected in accordance with the procedures established by ADB's Guidelines on the Use
of Consultants. The number of international consultants actually used (11) and their actual level
of effort (29.7 person months) differed somewhat from what was planned (eight consultants and
25.0 person months). No domestic consultants were used (or planned for). International
consultants planned included (i) a pension and provident funds expert and economist/team
leader (9 person-months), (ii) a legal expert (4 person-months), (iii) an actuary (4 person-
months), (iv) an accounting expert (3 person-months), (v) a systems expert (3 person-months),
and (vi) a training expert (2 person-months).

C.     Implementation and Cost

13.    In accordance with the TA's design, a team of international consultants was fielded
under the FPO of the Ministry of Finance, which served as the executing agency. The FPO
provided office space and other support. The TA was expected to begin work approximately
6 months after approval and to close 9 months later. Instead, it started almost 2 years after loan
approval and closed almost 3 years from its inception.

14.      TA delays are attributable to several factors. Initial delays are attributable to the political
environment created by the financial crisis in Thailand. Government staff were over-taxed and
resources were severely strained. Addressing immediate vulnerabilities in the financial sector,
not surprisingly, was given highest priority. Later delays are attributable to the design flaws
identified above. The need for greater public education ultimately resulting in a second phase of
TA being launched to help refine policy options.

15.   Given the financial crisis, this was a difficult period for Thailand and, as a result of
broader changes within the Thai Government during this period, there were frequent changes in
personnel at the FPO. Primary counterparts were replaced several times during the
implementation of the TA. None of the officials now working at the FPO were present when the
TA was implemented.
                                                                                 Appendix 5    37



16.     ADB's administration of the TA should be credited for keeping it on track. Sustained and
concerted involvement on the part of ADB staff created and maintained momentum for reform,
despite difficult circumstances. After replacing the initial mission leader, there were no changes
in leadership for the remainder of the 3-year period of the TA.

17.    The TA funds were not all utilized: $41,000 was not disbursed.

III.   Achievement of Purpose and Outcomes

A.     Performance of Consultants and Quality of Reports

18.     The mismatch between the expectations of the consultants (based on their TORs) and
those of the Government resulted, early in the implementation of the TA, in some initial
dissatisfaction with the performance of the consultants. These differences appear to have been
fully resolved once both parties better understood the other's agendas, constraints, and
concerns. Implementation then proceeded more smoothly. The quality of reports produced by
the consultants is very high, and many of their work products are still being used.

B.     TA Outputs

19.     The consultants produced a collection of technical studies that provided the most in-
depth analysis of this type ever carried out in Thailand. In addition to providing analysis of the
existing situation, these studies provided important benchmarks whereby government officials
can, in the future, examine and evaluate options for reform. The framework for reform proposed
by the consultants--which involved a multi-pillar pension system that greatly promoted the role
of the second pillar--proved highly contested by several stakeholders.

20.      Given this lack of buy-in and given the obvious gaps in the understanding of local
officials and financial market professionals, the Thai Government and ADB agreed to a second
phase of implementation under the TA. This second phase of activity focused on informing
Thailand's policy debate through public information campaigns, seminars, and workshops
intended to generate greater public understanding and awareness of pension reform issues.
Equally important, in this phase, the TA worked to resolve major differences of opinion among
stakeholders over the final structure of the proposed pension system.

21.      Two consultants provided the legal and actuarial support needed to examine a number
of reform options and analyze their socioeconomic implications under a variety of scenarios.
This support contributed to the building of consensus. This second phase of activity also
included the preparation of a detailed, medium-term road map for a set of actions required to
operationalize a multi-pillared pension system in Thailand, as well as the drafts of enabling
legislation needed to initiate these reforms.

C.     TA Outcomes

22.     As a result of this TA--and continued involvement on the part of ADB staff--a cabinet
Committee for Retirement and Old Age Policy was established and charged with the systematic
analysis of pension issues and the development of options for reform. The minister of Finance
chairs this committee. The minister of Labor serves as deputy chair. A subcommittee for drafting
pension and provident fund reforms was formed and is headed by the director general of the
FPO.
38     Appendix 5




23.     The pension framework proposed by the TA envisaged a multi-pillar pension system with
a second pillar (i.e., mandatory, defined contribution, privately managed pension funds). As
stated above, this structure was hotly contested by a number of stakeholders. However,
following TA-supported public information activities and training sessions, preliminary proposals
for a second pillar were made in early 2000. Based on these preparations, the Government
formally approved an action plan for the introduction of the second pillar and authorized further
work to determine its design and the time frame for its implementation.

24.     The subcommittee for drafting legislation to enact pension and provident fund reforms--
consisting of representatives of stakeholders from the labor unions, regulatory agencies,
employers, and the Government--has been supported by ADB through further actuarial and
policy analysis provided in 2001 and 2002 under this TA. This has resulted in proposals for an
integrated pension system and a blueprint for the phased introduction of the legal, regulatory,
and administrative reforms needed to implement the new system. During this time, the
Government has been carrying out public information campaigns to improve the public's
knowledge and understanding of retirement and savings issues. The increase in the general
level of awareness on pension issues has been significant.

IV.    Overall Assessment

25.     The TA was formulated during a period of financial crisis with the overarching objective
of reducing Thailand's vulnerability to external financial shocks by increasing the supply of long-
term capital. Despite the initial mismatch between the consultant's expectations and those of the
Government, the TA was timely and directly relevant. It was made more so by ADB
interventions to modify the initial design in response to the concerns raised by the Government
and the consultants. The study tour to Hong Kong, China, in particular, proved invaluable to
those policy makers who participated. The TA was efficacious in that it achieved its immediate
objective of encouraging the Government to take steps to reform Thailand's pension system
with the intention of promoting the role of funded pension schemes in the overall framework for
social insurance. There is a strong likelihood that the outcomes of this TA will result in Thailand
passing reforms to implement a new pension system. The TA was somewhat less efficient. It
was intended to last 9 months, whereas its implementation took more than 3 years. While the
second phase of work was necessary to broaden understanding and deepen support for the
work of the TA, it required additional resources not anticipated under the original design. The
level of the Government's commitment--as evidenced by work already in progress--is clear,
and the outcomes of this TA are likely to be highly sustainable. Institutional development has
been substantial. The Savings and Investment Department of the FPO, in collaboration with the
Government Pension Fund and other agencies, designed and implemented a highly effective
series of education materials--including printed materials, recorded media and television
programs, and workshops--at moderate cost to promote greater public understanding of--and
appreciation for--the need for reform. These activities have changed social attitudes. The
overall rating of this TA is successful.

V.     Conclusions

A.     Key Issues

26.    TA design must respect the specific needs, constraints, state of economic development,
human, and financial capacity of the country it is intended to support. To accomplish this, TA
designs should be based on an assessment of the capacity and commitment of the TA's
                                                                                   Appendix 5    39


executing and implementing agencies as well as on an assessment of broader public
understanding of (and appreciation for) issues of public policy--particularly those that are highly
politically charged.

27.    TA administration must not be relegated to staff with insufficient expertise in the areas
the TA is intended to address. The success of this TA is almost entirely attributable to the efforts
of one staff member. Careful attention by staff with the requisite knowledge and skills could
have addressed the design deficiencies of this TA prior to its implementation.

B.     Lessons Learned

28.      Pension reform is one of the most controversial and politically charged public policy
challenges facing any government. For persons living in societies with weak banking systems
and with economies vulnerable to inflation, public pension systems often represent the primary
--sometimes the only viable--savings vehicle. Changes in benefits or in the patterns of income
redistribution within a pension system can severely impact the welfare of the elderly in their
retirement. For many businesses, particularly those operating in countries with large informal
economies, the size of the social insurance levy represents a powerful incentive to underreport
wages and hire workers outside of formal labor arrangements. For many governments, social
insurance contributions represent a captive source of financing. As a consequence, pension
reform requires governments to balance competing social and practical interests and--like all
programs of insurance--changes in pension policy ultimately benefit some at the expense of
others.

29.     Given such political complexity, pension reform is typically a long-term endeavor that
can take many years, even if the political will exists to make changes rapidly. By implication,
reforms cannot impose from the top down. Crafting good technical solutions is only one of
several critical steps needed for pension reform to succeed. While a champion is needed to
spearhead the political process, reform almost inevitably requires a medium-term framework in
which stakeholders are given time and space to negotiate their interests. Although capacity
building and technical analysis are clearly necessary, they are not sufficient to assure success.
A strong emphasis must also be placed on public education not only for policy makers and
elected representatives but also for labor groups, employers, and other stakeholders. This
demands a flexible approach, not only in terms of how an individual TA is structured but also in
terms of the overall design for reform. A cluster of separate but related TAs may have proven
more effective in this case.

C.     Follow-Up Actions and Recommendations

30.    ADB should continue to provide support through the early implementation of recently
approved follow-on TA. ADB should partner with the World Bank and other aid agencies to
leverage their expertise and tap their resources. In particular, partnerships with other aid
agencies are essential as long as ADB's procurement/recruitment guidelines prevent the use of
experts from nonmember countries in Latin America and Eastern Europe.

        EVALUATION OF TA 3116-INO: REFORM OF PENSION AND PROVIDENT FUNDS

I.         Introduction

A.         Background

1.      Indonesia had one of the most vibrant economies in the region prior to the Asian
financial crisis that began in 1997. In response to the crisis, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
adopted a three-pronged strategy that included (i) financial sector restructuring, (ii) capital
market development, and (iii) improved management of public resources. As part of this
strategy, during the appraisal for Loan 1618-INO,1 the Government and ADB agreed to
undertake a comprehensive review of the pension system. Although technical assistance (TA)
3116-INO 2 was not attached to the program, it was considered to be part of ADB's overall
strategy for supporting the Government in its efforts to address near-term critical financial and
economic issues in the wake of the crisis.

2.      Indonesia's social insurance system includes (i) state-managed pension schemes (for
civil servants and members of the armed forces), and (ii) the Jamsostek provident fund (for
workers employed in the formal private sector). Participation in these schemes is mandatory.
Privately managed voluntary pension schemes are also available to many private sector
employees, either in the form of employer-sponsored plans (employer pension funds [EPFs]) or
financial institution pension funds (FIPFs), which are operated by banks and life insurance
companies.

3.       The Jamsostek provident fund, administered by PT Jamsostek, includes (i) a mandatory,
partially funded, pension scheme designed to provide retirement income for employees working
for companies with 10 or more employees; and (ii) separate insurance programs to cover
employment injury, death, and health care. Benefits paid under the pension scheme are
financed on the basis of contributions equal to 3.7% of taxable wages (paid by employers) and
2.0% of taxable wages (paid by employees). The scheme provides coverage to approximately
13 million persons or 43.3% of the formal labor force. At the time the TA was being designed,
total assets held by Jamsostek amounted to about Rp7 trillion ($946 million). Returns on
investments, however, were low--below that which could be obtained on bank deposits. This
was, at least in part, due to unreasonably high administrative expenses--around 12% of
contributions--far in excess of expense ratios in neighboring Malaysia (2.0% of contributions) or
Singapore (0.5% of contributions).

4.      In April 1992, the Government enacted the Law on Pension Funds. This law provides the
legal foundation for the establishment, administration, and regulation of EPFs and FIPFs. At the
time the TA was being designed, some 303 enterprises and 25 financial institutions had
established a pension fund under the law. Employers are not required to establish a fund, but if
they choose to do so, they are required to legally establish it as a separate legal entity. Given
the high administrative costs involved, many smaller employers have joined one of the FIPFs,
rather than establishing their own fund. At the time the TA was being designed, approximately
674 enterprises had joined an FIPF. 3

1
     Loan 1618-INO: Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development-Program Loan, for $1.4 billion, approved on
     25 June 1998. This loan represented a special intervention by ADB and was made in direct response to the Asian
     financial crisis.
2
     TA 3116-INO: Reform of Pension and Provident Funds, for $870,000, approved on 11 December 1998.
3
     Almost half (321) of these enterprises were members of just one FIPF (Bank Negara Indonesia).
                                                                                   Appendix 6     41



5.      Additional legal requirements under the Law on Pension Funds include (i) benefits must
be determined using either a defined-benefit or defined-contribution benefit formula; (ii) rights to
benefits must be governed by clearly defined vesting requirements; (iii) employers must respect
the vested accrued rights of employees whose employment is terminated or who resign their
position prior to reaching retirement; and (iv) schemes should provide for limited portability (i.e.,
the ability to transfer accumulated vested funds from one pension fund to another upon
switching jobs). Contributions to pension funds are not subjected to taxation. Benefits paid by
pension funds are taxed as ordinary income. Private pension schemes must be licensed by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), which supervises their operation. All private pension schemes are
required to appoint a supervisory board, plan administrator, custodian bank, external auditor,
and an actuary.

6.      EPFs and FIPFs are generally fully funded. The maximum contribution rate is 20% of
taxable wage income. Employees may contribute no more than 60% of what is contributed by
their employers. Since February 1997, private pension schemes have been permitted to invest
their assets in mutual funds, in addition to those asset classes already permitted under the 1992
Law (shares, bonds, and marketable securities). At the time the TA was being designed, total
accumulated assets under the EPFs and FIPFs amounted to 10% of gross domestic product.
This is far lower than what was observed in Malaysia or Singapore at the time, where private
pension assets amounted to 40% and 60% of gross domestic product, respectively. Despite
relatively low levels of participation, EPFs and FIPFs had accumulated more assets than the
publicly managed programs, including Jamsostek.

B.     Rationale and Concept

7.      The TA report raised general concerns about the (i) lack of uniformity and consistency in
the legal framework between public and private sector pension schemes, (ii) low rates of return
and high administrative expenses, and (iii) inefficient methods of operation within both public
and private sector schemes. The public pension schemes were suspected of not being
financially viable as a result of low contribution rates and long-term demographic pressures
expected to eventually arise from the aging of the country's population. The TA report also
noted that a widespread lack of public awareness discouraged private sector employees from
contributing beyond what was minimally required under the Jamsostek scheme. Unclear
delineation of responsibilities and the lack of functional autonomy of enforcement resulted in
weak oversight. Only 83,000 of approximately 187,000 firms required to enroll their employees
in the Jamsostek scheme were actually doing so. This resulted in less than 20% of the
workforce being enrolled. Investment decisions were also subject to inappropriate political
influence. These were the issues the TA was intended to address.

C.     Objective and Scope

8.      This TA was intended to (i) strengthen the financial sector by promoting the development
of the nonbank financial sector and alternative sources of long-term financing for investment,
and (ii) reduce poverty and improve social protection by promoting the development of partially
funded or fully funded pension schemes. The scope provided for two phases. In the first phase,
the scope required (i) the actuarial analysis of the financial sustainability of current and any
proposed pension schemes; (ii) an in-depth analysis of the impediments to the development of
employer pension funds and those sponsored by financial institutions; (iii) a feasibility analysis
of the restructuring of Jamsostek, the provident fund for private sector employees; and (iv) the
audit of existing pension schemes, supported by proposals for their restructuring. On the basis
42      Appendix 6


of what was learned in the first phase, the second phase of the scope called for
recommendations for (i) increasing the level of social security coverage and mobilizing more
resources; (ii) creating or modifying investment policies, guidelines, regulations, and legislation;
and (iii) instituting operational procedures to encourage the professional management of
pension and provident funds in both the public and private sectors.

D.      Evaluation

9.       The TA was evaluated by the operational department responsible for it. This self-
evaluation rated the TA as successful. An Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM) visited
Indonesia in July 2003. The OEM held discussions with a large number of institutions, market
participants, the TA executing agency (EA), regulatory authorities, and other stakeholders. This
evaluation is based on (i) a review of the rationale, purpose, and expected outcomes of each
TA; and (ii) an analysis of actual outcomes and impacts as revealed in discussions by the OEM.
The OEM reviewed relevant ADB records, analyzed pertinent data collected in the field, and
supplemented this information with follow-up discussions with ADB staff and additional research
when needed. The OEM evaluated the TA in terms of (i) the relevance of its design in relation to
its underlying rationale and objectives, as well as its consistency with the Government's
priorities for the sector and with ADB's sector strategy; (ii) the achievement of its design
objectives; (iii) the efficiency of its implementation; (iv) the sustainability of its contributions; and
(v) the magnitude and significance of its impacts.

II.     Assessment of Design and Scope

A.      Design

10.      The design of this TA was ambitious. Its terms of reference (TOR) spanned two phases
and included such tasks as (i) conducting opinion surveys, (ii) preparing a full financial and
actuarial analysis of the existing pension schemes, (iii) preparing an actuarial and financial
analysis of alternate reform scenarios, (iv) reviewing the legal framework, (v) reviewing tax
policy, (vi) crafting recommendations to recover pension losses attributed to the financial crisis,
(vii) making recommendations to improve market oversight including steps to strengthen the
legal and regulatory frameworks, (viii) drafting legislation to help create the institutional
framework for the proposed pension and provident fund system, (ix) holding workshops to
disseminate results and recommendations and increase public understanding, and (x) preparing
a final report.

11.     Even under ideal conditions, these tasks could not have been accomplished within the
proposed timeframe and budget of the TA. In addition, the design of the TA was flawed in that
there was one EA--the Director General of Financial Institutions (DGFI) in MOF--but the task of
implementation was handled by several other agencies including the Ministry of State-Owned
Enterprises, the Ministry of Manpower, and the Ministry of Defense. Coordination between these
implementing agencies was meant to take place through a high-level steering committee. In
practice, this approach proved to be ineffective, and the consultants were unable to access
much of the information they needed under the TOR and, ultimately, failed to gain consensus
and buy-in for their recommendations.

B.      Engagement of Consultants

12.   The TA was implemented through a private consulting firm. The firm and its consultants
were selected under a simplified technical proposal in accordance with the procedures
                                                                                             Appendix 6      43


established by ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The number of international
consultants actually used (three) and their actual level of effort (17.5 person months) differed--
but not substantially--from what was planned (three consultants and 16.0 person months).
Likewise, the number of domestic consultants actually used (four) and their actual level of effort
(15.4 person months) differed slightly from what was planned (four consultants and 22.0 person
months). International consultants planned were (i) a pension and provident fund expert
(6 person-months), (ii) an actuary and financial advisor (6 person-months), and (iii) a legal and
regulatory expert for pension and provident funds (4 person-months). Domestic consultants
included (i) an accountant (6 person-months), (ii) an audit specialist (6 person-months), (iii) an
economist (6 person-months), and (iv) a legal expert (4 person-months).

C.        Implementation and Cost

13.     In accordance with the formulation of the TA, the DGFI served as the EA for the TA and
provided office space and other support to the consultants fielded under the TA. The TA started
3 months later and closed 7 months later than was originally planned. Closing delays were, in
part, due to start-up delays, but were also attributable to the inexperience of the consultants
fielded, lack of cooperation from counterparts, overly ambitious TOR, and inadequate guidance
(both from the Government and from ADB).

14.     This TA underscores the difficulties faced in overcoming a major flaw in TA design. In
accordance with the TA's formulation, the working group--headed by the DGFI and staffed by
representatives from the Pensions Directorate, Ministry of Manpower, and Ministry of Defense--
intended to oversee the implementation of the TA was never active. This proved highly
detrimental to the TA's implementation. Lack of coordination on issues of pension policy
contributed to the consultants' difficulties in accessing the information and data they needed
from the various implementing agencies. Appeals by the consultants for ADB intervention went
unanswered until new ADB staff with the experience and technical expertise necessary to
effectively manage the TA were appointed to administer the TA toward the end of its life. The
TA was completed and funds were fully utilized under new ADB administration.

D.        Organization and Management

15.      The Government remarked to the OEM that the consultants' office was poorly staffed
and appeared to be poorly managed for much of the TA. The consultants seemed to have
lacked the experience needed to administer a TA of this magnitude and relied heavily on the
administrative skills of another ADB TA4 (both TAs were domiciled in the same building). It was
suggested that these difficulties may have been, in part, responsible for tension between the
TA's consultants and their counterparts and may have contributed to lower quality output on the
part of the TA.

III.      Achievement of Purpose and Outcomes

A.        Performance of Consultants and Quality of Reports

16.    Despite the administrative difficulties noted above, the efficiency of TA operations and
the consultants' performance was, on the whole, satisfactory. Relationships with counterparts
were moderately strained by the consultants' needs for sensitive information and data to
analyze and evaluate the mandatory pension schemes. The Government expressed concerns

4
    TA 3119-INO: Regulatory Reforms in the Insurance Industry, for $800,000, approved on 15 December 1998.
44     Appendix 6


about the international consultants' scheduling of time in Indonesia and frustration with the
absence of a continual point of contact over the course of the TA. As a result, some officials
characterized the activities of the TA as being erratic.

B.     TA Outputs

17.     The analysis, findings, and recommendations of the consultants were presented in a
final report which provided (i) baseline financial analysis of the existing mandatory pension
schemes; (ii) recommendations for legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms; (iii) proposed
amendments to the tax laws; (iv) the results of the stakeholder opinion survey; (v) actuarial
analyses for selected scenarios to assess the liabilities of the mandatory programs;
(vi) comparative information on other pension programs in other countries; (vii) information on
international best practices; and (viii) selected options for reforming the mandatory programs.

18.    A public opinion survey helped gauge stakeholder perceptions of the existing mandatory
public pension schemes and of private schemes. The opinion survey included interviews with
representatives of various stakeholders, including EPFs, FIPFs, lawyers, accountants,
actuaries, and fund managers.

19.     A valuation of the civil service and the armed forces pension funds was completed and
assessments were made as to the fiscal sustainability of these systems. The consultants also
analyzed the schemes under possible future economic and demographic scenarios. The
valuation of the civil service pension scheme raised concerns regarding its fiscal sustainability--
concerns which are being pursued by the Government. The audit and evaluation of other
schemes--particularly Jamsostek--were never conducted, however, because the consultants
were denied access to the data they needed (although they did provide extensive
recommendations using other sources, such as a Klynveld, Peat, Marwick, and Goerdeler
[KPMG] assessment of financial statements).

20.      One of the major benefits of the TA was the ability to gather information on the impact of
the Asian financial crisis on private pension funds and other nonbanking financial sector
institutions. In the TA's TOR, it was simply assumed that pension funds incurred significant
losses as a result of the economic crisis. However, the consultants determined through an
analysis of private sector pension plans that assets grew disproportionately to plan liabilities and
that most pension plans consolidated their funding over the crisis period. This analysis revealed
the more important issue facing pension funds: whether the benefit formulas they used would
provide adequate income for plan participants in their retirement.

21.     Some of the key recommendations of the TA included (i) a full independent audit of
Jamsostek and reform measures to reduce its costs, increase its contributions, and adjust its
key parameters (including replacement rates and retirement ages), improve compliance and
enforcement, and segregate its funds; (ii) the introduction of a competitive mandatory
accumulation system based on the Hong Kong, China model (one that permits corporate, open,
and industry-wide plans and also accommodates both defined benefit and defined contribution
benefit formulas); (iii) the consolidation and harmonization of regulatory requirements and the
relaxation of investment restrictions; (iv) the imposition of a requirement for independent
directors on corporate boards and other measures to improve governance; (v) education and
training programs to develop capacity and heighten understanding and awareness; and (vi) the
elimination of the existing requirement to pay dividends and taxes to the government on the
investment returns of the mandatory pension schemes.

C.        TA Outcome

22.      The final report of the TA was of lower quality than was anticipated which, to some
degree, reflected problems with the original design and the TA's implementation and
management. However, as was noted in the TA completion report, the analysis contained in the
final report did provide useful background information and formed the basis for a pension reform
framework for Loan 1965-INO.5

23.      In addition, the 2-day workshop organized by the TA in Jakarta in August 2000 helped to
disseminate the TA's findings and provided a strategic forum for debate among government
officials, academics, trade union officials, and other stakeholders. The workshop was
considered to be an effective vehicle for sharing analysis and findings and for obtaining
feedback on proposed recommendations. Of the 135 persons invited, 98 attended the first day
of the workshop and 86 attended the second day.

24.    Perhaps, the TA's most immediate positive impact was the identification of potentially
serious financial problems with the civil service pension fund. As discussed earlier, the
Government has taken up this issue. A full audit is being planned for the scheme, which has the
endorsement of the International Monetary Fund.

IV.       Overall Assessment

25.     Given the financial crisis and the clearly compelling need to (i) address weakness in the
financial sector, (ii) promote the development of domestic sources of long-term capital to fuel
economic recovery, and (iii) improve the management of public resources, the TA was clearly
relevant and timely. It was efficacious because it achieved its immediate objective of promoting
pension and provident fund reform. The outputs of the TA contributed directly to ADB's
continuing dialogue with the Government on reforms to the nonbank financial sector. The TA
was less efficient, however, as it started and closed late. It is also not apparent whether the
outputs of the TA have sufficient government commitment and support. For this reason,
sustainability is assessed as being unlikely. ADB staff working on other financial sector issues in
Indonesia, however, have drawn upon the final report of the TA. As a result, its outputs may be
sustained by virtue of becoming part of a broader dialogue on financial sector reform. There has
been no substantial institutional impact. The overall rating of this TA is partly successful.

V.        Conclusions

A.        Key Issues

26.     The consultants delivered work products largely within their TOR. Coordination and
cooperation, however, among interested parties--the Government, the consultants, and ADB--
could have been more effective during the implementation of the TA. A contributing factor to
poor coordination and cooperation may have been the fact that a presidential task force on
social protection, headed by the Indonesian Vice President, was initiated at roughly the same
time. The work of the TA became increasingly isolated once the task force began its work. The
perspective, emphasis, and recommendations of these two efforts were very different. While the
design of the TA could not have foreseen the establishment of such a task force or anticipated

    on 10 December 2002.
46        Appendix 6


its impact, the TA could have been designed to be more realistic in its scope and more flexible.
Combined with better coordination with counterparts, the quality of the TA's outputs would likely
have been higher.

B.        Lessons Learned

27.       The key lessons highlighted by this TA include:

          (i)     Coordinating the work of a TA is more difficult in cases where the EA does not
                  have authority over all of the issues the TA is designed to address. In this case,
                  the DGFI in MOF was the EA, but some of the TA issues fell under the
                  jurisdiction of the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, the Ministry of Manpower,
                  or the Ministry of Defense. None of these entities were adequately addressed by
                  the design of the TA.
          (ii)    The establishment of a high-level steering committee for implementing a TA does
                  not necessarily create an accessible and effective channel of communication.
                  Such committees should be carefully constituted to insure that they do not
                  inadvertently slow down the progress of a TA or even hamper its ability to
                  accomplish its objectives.
          (iii)   The continued presence of international consultants over a longer timeframe may
                  improve the odds of success for TAs addressing politically difficult issues.
          (iv)    The TA design must respect the specific needs, constraints, state of economic
                  development, human, and financial capacity of the country it is intended to
                  support. Overly ambitious designs for countries with low levels of institutional
                  development are bound to fall short of expectations.
          (v)     The use of Bahasa Indonesia translators should be considered for future
                  workshops in Indonesia to facilitate dialogue for some participants.

C.        Follow-Up Actions and Recommendations

28.    An audit of Jamsostek is scheduled to be conducted using some of the funds left
undisbursed under TA Loan 1620-INO.6 Large portions of the reform agenda directed at
reforming Jamsostek and those reforms addressing the harmonization of the legal, tax, and
regulatory frameworks for pension funds have been incorporated into the proposed Financial
Governance and Social Security Reform Program (Phase II) currently under discussion with the
Government. The Pension Directorate with MOF has been making progress in terms of
improving standards and adopting practices in line with the standards and plans development
pursuant to a letter of intent signed jointly by the Government and the International Monetary
Fund.

                           EVALUATION OF TA 3134 UZB: PENSION REFORM

I.         Introduction

A.         Background

1.      The pension system Uzbekistan inherited from the former Soviet Union was based on
the concept of solidarity across generations. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
termination of the budgetary support it provided, large arrears developed in the payment of
pension benefits in the early 1990s. In 1991, the Government initiated a program of reforms
intended to restore financial balance to the pension system by (i) imposing a 32% payroll tax on
enterprises, (ii) more directly connecting benefits paid in retirement to pre-retirement wages and
service history, and (iii) establishing a fund to accumulate and distribute the contributions made
to the pension system by enterprises and workers.

2.      In 1994, the Government passed the Law on State Pension Security. This law
established the legal basis for old age retirement benefits, disability allowances, and survivor
allowances (allowances paid to the dependent survivors of a breadwinner who died
prematurely). The retirement age was set at age 60 (for men) and age 55 (for women).
Employers were required to contribute at the rate of 36% of taxable wages and 0.5% of gross
sales. Employees were required to contribute at the rate of 1.5% of their taxable wages.

3.      The resulting pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) pension system operated with a financial deficit
until 1998 when it generated a small surplus. Despite the modest improvement in the financial
position of the fund, its long-term sustainability was in doubt, given the absence of a reserve
fund to meet future liabilities and to protect it against economic downturns and long-term
demographic changes. In light of these concerns and other problems in the structure of the
system, the Ministry of Social Maintenance (MSM) prepared a strategy for reforming the system
and for assessing the possibility of introducing voluntary private pension funds (referred to in the
technical assistance [TA] documentation as voluntary supplemental pensions) by 1999­2000.

B.         Rationale and Concept

4.       In addition to the issue of long-term sustainability, the pension system suffered from a
number of fundamental design flaws and operational problems including (i) high contribution
rates, (ii) arrears in the payment of contributions by employers, (iii) low participation rates (which
suggested that a substantial portion of the working population was successfully evading the
system), (iv) special privileges awarded to certain categories of workers, (v) early retirement
provisions for persons working in hazardous conditions or in designated special occupations,
(vi) high system dependency ratios,1 (vii) low replacement rates,2 (viii) the use of contributions to
provide other forms of social assis tance (such as support for low income families), (ix) ad hoc
and poorly structured benefit increases that further eroded the connection between contributions
and benefits, and (x) administrative weaknesses (such as the absence of business planning and
irregular and inadequate financial audits).

5.     The Government's plan for reforming the pension system focused on (i) increasing the
retirement age in a phased manner over a 10 to 12-year horizon and, eventually, equalizing

1
     System dependency ratio refers to the number of beneficiaries for each contributing worker in a system of social
     insurance and is one measure of a system's financial condition.
2
     Replacement rate refers to benefits divided by pre-retirement compensation and is one measure of a pension
     system's generosity and benefit adequacy.
48        Appendix 7



retirement ages for men and women; (ii) eliminating special privileges; (iii) amending existing
legislation for the pension system; and (iv) considering legislation to introduce voluntary private
pension funds. These policy reforms, if correctly designed and if fully implemented, were
intended to lay a foundation for a financially sound and sustainable pension system.

6.      To implement the pension reform, as was outlined in the Government's strategy, the
Government requested TA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. The
two institutions shared responsibility for the overall effort and coordinated closely on their
individual responsibilities under their joint work program.

C.        Objective and Scope

7.       The TA was intended to support the Government's pension reform agenda by (i) offering
recommendations for modernizing administrative and financial management processes in the
current PAYGO system; and (ii) developing an enabling operational, legal, and regulatory
environment for the introduction of fully funded voluntary private pension funds. The scope
included (i) a review of the administrative and management processes of the public pension
fund; (ii) an independent external (international) financial audit of the fund; (iii) the formulation of
a sound legal and regulatory basis for the introduction of private pension funds; (iv) the
identification of the legal and regulatory measures needed in the capital markets to support the
introduction of private pension funds; (v) the identification of financial sector preconditions to
facilitate pension reform--including operational, legal, and regulatory conditions within capital
market institutions, insurance and asset management companies, and custodians, etc.--and an
analysis of the impact of the reform on the capital markets; (vi) detailed sector studies to assess
the feasibility of introducing private pension funds; (vii) an analysis of the social dimensions of
the pension reform, particularly with regard to private pension funds, in a participatory and
survey framework; and (viii) the launch of a pilot project in Samarkand to improve data collection
and processing.3

D.        Evaluation

8.       The TA was evaluated by the operational department responsible for it. This self-
evaluation rated the TA as successful. An Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM) visited
Uzbekistan in August 2003. The OEM held discussions with a large number of institutions,
market participants, TA executing agencies, regulatory authorities, and other stakeholders. This
evaluation is based on (i) a review of the rationale, purpose, and expected outcomes of each
TA; and (ii) an analysis of actual outcomes and impacts as revealed in discussions by the OEM.
The OEM reviewed relevant ADB records, analyzed pertinent data collected in the field, and
supplemented this information with follow-up discussions with ADB staff and additional research
when needed. The OEM evaluated the TA in terms of (i) the relevance of its design in relation to
its underlying rationale and objectives, as well as its consistency with the Government's
priorities for the sector and with ADB's sector strategy; (ii) the achievement of its design
objectives; (iii) the efficiency of its implementation; (iv) the sustainability of its contributions; and
(v) the magnitude and significance of its impacts.


3
    The Samarkand pilot project was also supported by a World Bank TA, for $350,000, which funded the
    (i) preparation of an actuarial model to analyze the financial implications of pension reform options based on
    alternative economic and demographic scenarios, (ii) implementation of the Samarkand pilot project and the
    development of a management information system, and (iii) preparation of a campaign to educate the public on the
    proposed new pension system. The results of the actuarial modeling exercise were intended to provide background
    data and information for the design of pension reform to be supported by ADB's TA.
                                                                                                  Appendix 7      49


II.       Assessment of Design and Scope

A.        Design

9.     The TA had a limited scope that included providing support to the Government to
strengthen the existing PAYGO public pension system and to lay the foundations for the
introduction of voluntary private pensions. Many of the tasks under the terms of reference (TOR)
focused on diagnostic assessments, rather than the drafting of large roadmaps for reforms that
the Government would have been unlikely to adopt. Its design benefited greatly from technical
discussions with the Government held before the TA design was finalized. In this sense, the
design was demand-driven, and its agreements were recorded in the form of a memorandum of
understanding co-signed by the Government.

10.     The design also reflected an emphasis on (i) social policy issues, including the alignment
of contributions and benefits and the need to address gender disparities in retirement ages and
service requirements; and (ii) fiscal policy issues, including the need to separate pension fund
accumulations from the reserve funds of MSM. The design included components intended to
promote broader awareness of pension issues in order to help build consensus for reform.

11.      The TA was designed in collaboration with the World Bank and represents an effective
example of inter-agency cooperation whereby the overall mission was divided between the two
institutions to take advantage of their comparative strengths and available resources. The TORs
for consulting services were well written and consistent with the objectives of the TA design.

B.        Engagement of Consultants

12.     The TA was implemented through a private consulting firm. The firm and its consultants
were selected in accordance with the procedures established by ADB's Guidelines on the Use
of Consultants. The number of international consultants actually used (six) and their actual level
of effort (19.5 person months) differed very slightly from what was planned (six consultants and
18.5 person months). The number of domestic consultants actually used (eight) and their actual
level of effort (39.7 person months) differed substantially from what was planned (five
consultants and 28.0 person months). International consultants included (i) a pension specialist
and coordinator, (ii) an audit specialist, (iii) an administrative reform specialist, (iv) a legal
specialist, (v) a capital markets specialist, and (vi) a social dimensions specialist. Some delays
in recruiting appropriately qualified consultants were experienced.

C.        Implementation and Cost

13.     MSM was the executing agency for the TA and provided the required administrative and
logistical support to the TA's consultants. The computer equipment and software needed for the
Samarkand pilot project was procured by MSM in accordance with procedures that were
acceptable to ADB.

14.    At the time of the TA's inception in July 1999, the newly appointed minister of MSM
expressed concerns about the TA scope. At issue was the recent shift in views on pension
reform at the highest levels of government following difficulties in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz
Republic with new pension systems.4 Indeed, the previous minister of MSM was replaced
because of his efforts to reform the pension system at a politically sensitive time in Uzbekistan.
4
    In the case of Kazakhstan, these difficulties proved to be temporary as the country moved to a fully funded system
    (ADB. 2003. Program Performance Audit Report on the Pension Reform Program in Kazakhstan. Manila.).
50     Appendix 7



A second concern was the confidentiality of data for the financial audit of the pension fund. This
issue was discussed and the TA was ultimately able to proceed once a memorandum of
understanding was signed that confirmed the advisory nature of the TA and established an
agreement regarding the confidentiality of the audit results.

15.      While the consultants successfully provided analysis and advice on most of the issues
identified in their TOR--including, for example, the issues, administration, and management of
the PAYGO system; capital market development; and the social dimensions of systems of social
insurance--they continued to face difficulties with obtaining the information they needed for the
financial audit of the pension fund and with establishing the legal and regulatory basis for
voluntary private pension schemes. ADB launched three review missions to clarify the purpose
and intentions behind these components and to restore MSM's support for the TA.

III.   Achievement of Purpose and Outcomes

A.     Performance of Consultants and Quality of Reports

16.      Despite the difficulties identified above, the performance of the consultants was, on the
whole, satisfactory. The Government had initially demonstrated strong commitment to reform at
the time the TA was being designed. However, the Government's overall commitment and
support for the implementation of the TA wavered somewhat because the leadership at MSM
changed (para. 14). The consultants were ultimately able to adjust to these challenges and to
focus on the issues identified in their TOR, although they continued to encounter resistance
when attempting to obtain information and data for the financial audit of the pension fund. Their
final report, supported by a number of appendixes, was comprehensive and of high quality.

B.     TA Outputs and Impacts

17.     The outputs of the TA were primarily advisory in nature and included (i) proposed
amendments to the Law on State Pensions, (ii) suggestions for improving the administration and
management of the pension fund, (iii) recommendations for the design of the legal and
regulatory framework for voluntary private pension funds, (iv) suggestions for developing the
capital markets, (v) recommendations intended to strengthen controls and financial procedures,
(vi) analysis of the social dimensions and institutional environment for voluntary private
pensions, and (vii) support for the Samarkand pilot project. These outputs are discussed further
below.

18.     Amendments to the law on state pensions were proposed in order to (i) better align
contributions and benefits, (ii) address gender disparities in retirement ages and service
requirements, (iii) streamline early retirement provisions and social allowances, (iv) rationalize
and minimize exemptions from making payroll contributions to the pension fund, (v) eliminate ad
hoc decrees or other Government resolutions that had the effect of undermining the legal
authority of the pension fund and which resulted in frequently changing pension provisions, and
(vi) legally separate the accounts of the pension fund from those of the MSM and of the state
budget to enhance accountability on the part of the pension fund.

19.    Reforms for the administration and management of the pension system were suggested.
Recommendations included measures to (i) integrate workload projections with strategic and
business planning; (ii) introduce of a nationwide unique personal identification number (PIN)
system and integrate this system with the tax collection process (in cooperation with the State
Tax Committee); and (iii) reduce the burden of data collection on enterprises by streamlining
                                                                                   Appendix 7     51


government processes. As part of the TA, and with support from the World Bank, a seminar was
held on the Administration of Pension Program Collections in February 2000. Representatives
of nine countries participated in the seminar. Following the seminar, the Government
established an interministerial committee--comprising MSM, the Ministry of Finance, and the
State Tax Committee--to expedite work on the PIN system. The TA supported this activity until
July 2000. The committee was still active at the time of the OEM in August 2003 and appeared
close to choosing between two proposed PIN systems.

20.     Recommendations for the design of the legal and regulatory framework for voluntary
private pension funds were made. These recommendations addressed such issues as
(i) program design, fund management, internal controls, and effective governance; (ii) the need
for the rigorous regulation of voluntary private pension funds, the importance of provisions to
assure the safe custody of invested funds, and the need to build confidence on the part of
participants; (iii) the registration and licensing regime for institutions as well as market
professionals; and (iv) the need for enforcement audits and regulatory provisions on guarantees
against losses for defined-benefit schemes.

21.    Recommendations for broadening and deepening the capital markets were proposed.
Recommendations focused on (i) the privatization of state-owned enterprises, (ii) the issuance
of corporate bonds, (iii) the adoption of international accounting standards by joint-stock
companies, (iv) the listing criteria used by the Tashkent Stock Exchange, (v) the enactment of
changes to the tax code to reduce capital gains taxes and eliminate the double taxation of
dividends, and (vi) the improvement of the legal framework to encourage better corporate
governance on the part of joint-stock companies.

22.     Recommendations to strengthen controls and financial procedures were made to
improve the financial management of the pension fund. These included recommendations to
(i) adopt international accounting standards by the pension fund and modernize accounts
management, (ii) formulate guidelines for the collection of contributions and the payment of
benefits, (iii) conduct regular audits by external audit firms, (iv) strengthen risk analysis and
management capacity, and (v) correct discrepancies between bank balances and reported cash
balances.

23.     An analysis of the social dimensions and institutional environment for voluntary pensions
was conducted. This analysis revealed tentative support for the introduction of voluntary private
pension schemes but revealed (i) widespread concern that such schemes might not prove to be
sufficiently independent of state control, and (ii) a deep mistrust of financial institutions. The TA
provided recommendations for strengthening the financial sector institutional environment to
promote voluntary private pensions, with a focus on the banking sector environment, the skills
and capacity of finance professionals, and the current underdeveloped state of the insurance
sector.

24.    The Samarkand pilot project was launched with $52,000 of support from ADB (for the
procurement of computer equipment) and $40,000 of additional support from the World Bank.
The pilot project was implemented in all districts within Samarkand Province in order to
modernize systems for the collection of contributions and the payment of pensions. The project
provided a vehicle for testing, on a continuing basis, the effectiveness of new software and
database programs. Productivity has improved--four workers now do the work that eight
workers did previously--and accuracy and efficiency have also improved with fewer errors in
payments and more timely updating of death and new pensioner records. The pilot project has
52     Appendix 7



been so successful that the Government is supporting its expansion to other districts in
Uzbekistan.

IV.    Overall Assessment

25.     The TA was relevant and timely. It was designed and implemented in response to the
Government's stated intention to enact reforms in the social sector. The TA was efficacious
because it achieved its immediate purpose of providing advice to the Government on issues
related to the existing pension system and also on issues related to the introduction of voluntary
private pension schemes. There is a reasonable likelihood that the Government will eventually
enact reforms to the pension system. The TA was somewhat less efficient. While there is
evidence of support for the outcomes of the TA, there is clearly strong reluctance on the part of
the Government to relax its control over the economy or to move quickly on the reforms
proposed under the TA. That said, it is likely that the Government will eventually embrace some
of those reforms. Sustainability, therefore, is likely. The TA clearly succeeded in broadening the
understanding of pension policy on the part of its counterparts within the MSM and, in doing so,
made some institutional impact. The overall rating of this TA is successful.

V.     Conclusions

A.     Key Issues

26.    The use of TA to provide diagnostic assessments and make recom mendations in
support of the Government's incremental approach to pension reform proved to be a sound
approach in Uzbekistan and has likely resulted in the TA having greater impact than it would
otherwise have had. Having a TA conduct financial reviews of state-owned or controlled
agencies, however, should not be supported under an advisory TA because of the impossibility
of monitoring and following-up on such reviews once the TA has been implemented and closed.

B.     Lessons Learned

27.    The key lessons highlighted by this TA include:

       (i)     In transition economies, TA can make important contributions by helping policy
               makers to better understand the issues they are charged with managing and by
               providing forward-looking recommendations to guide policy decisions in the
               future.
       (ii)    Jointly coordinated efforts with other aid agencies can be effective in terms of
               leveraging comparative strengths and available resources.
       (iii)   Advisory TAs dealing with complex public policy issues should be implemented
               over a 15 to 18-month period.

C.     Follow-Up Actions and Recommendations

28.     ADB should continue to engage the Government in policy dialogues in support of
pension reform. While there was initial reluctance to the introduction of voluntary private pension
plans, the Government appears willing to consider steps to broaden social insurance coverage
and to improve financial intermediation through the nonbank financial sector.

     EVALUATION OF TA 3367-IND: REFORM OF THE PRIVATE PENSION AND PROVIDENT
     FUNDS SYSTEM REFORM AND THE EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND ORGANIZATION

I.         Introduction

A.         Background

1.      During the Asian Development Bank's (ADB's) 1999 Country Programming Mission, the
Government of India requested technical assistance (TA) from ADB to support the development
of India's capital markets. The Government had grown concerned with the shortage of long-term
capital to finance infrastructure and wished to promote the issuance of longer-term financial
products to fund capital investments and achieve higher levels of economic growth. Three TAs
were launched to help create an enabling environment for long-term capital formation. These
included TAs to support (i) reforms for pension and provident funds,1 (ii) capacity building for the
insurance regulator, 2 and (iii) development of the domestic debt market.3

2.      India's pensions and provident funds include (i) funds for civil servants working for the
central and state governments; (ii) the Employees' Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) for
private sector employees; (iii) various other provident funds; and (iv) voluntary schemes
provided by insurance companies, the Unit Trust of India, and asset management companies.
At the time the TA was being designed, these schemes covered only about 10% of India's
estimated labor force of 397 million persons. The majority of the work force was excluded from
these schemes by virtue of being self-employed or employed in the informal sector.

3.      EPFO is India's largest social insurance organization. It was founded under the
Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act of 1952. EPFO administers
(i) the provident fund for approximately 19 million beneficiaries (roughly half of all
nongovernment salaried workers in the formal sector); (ii) the Employees' Pension Scheme
which is financed on the basis of matching contributions from 262,000 employers and
contributions from the Central Government; and (iii) the Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance
Fund. At the time the TA was being designed, the capital of these three funds totaled
Rs655 billion ($15.4 billion). EPFO is overseen by a Central Board of Trustees, consisting of
representatives from central and state governments, employers, and workers. It is chaired by
the minister of Labor.

B.         Rationale and Concept

4.       At the time the TA was being designed, it had become clear that traditional family-based
mechanisms for ensuring old age security had become increasingly unable to cope in India with
lengthening life expectancy and rising medical costs. These factors, along with India's changing
demographics, elevated pension reform in the Government's priorities. Of concern was the
haphazard nature of pension coverage, which was the result of individual pension schemes
being developed and amended over several decades without the benefit of an overarching plan
for social insurance. Gaps in coverage in the formal sector, the lack of coverage for large
numbers of persons working in the informal sector, and organizational and administrative
inefficiencies demanded attention.

5.      Prior studies had shown that two key weaknesses were undermining the effectiveness of
the existing schemes in providing long-term capital to support investment: poor accumulation
and restrictive investment guidelines. Poor accumulation was the consequence of early
withdrawals used by scheme participants to finance housing, health care, and higher education
during their working years. Low rates of return were attributed to rigid investment guidelines that
limited pension and provident funds investments primarily to government securities. It was
believed that the liberalization of investment guidelines would benefit plan participants by
improving portfolio diversification (thereby lowering risk while raising average returns) and would
benefit capital market development by promoting greater involvement on the part of fund
managers in India's financial markets. The liberalization of investment guidelines for pension
and provident funds was one of several actions to eliminate impediments to financial market
development under Loan 1408-IND.4

6.      The rationale of the TA was to support the Government in its effort to (i) improve the
effectiveness and reach of existing schemes of social insurance, paying particular attention to
EPFO; (ii) liberalize investment policies (in conjunction with measures to improve regulatory
oversight and assure the prudent management of invested funds); and (iii) develop an
overarching framework for social insurance in India.

C.        Objective and Scope

7.      The objective of the TA was to create a pension reform framework and to present
practical options, supported by cost analysis, for the structuring of a more efficient, equitable,
transparent, and sustainable private sector pension and provident funds system. The scope
included (i) conducting a study of both formal and informal mechanisms of retirement income
support, including the identification of long-term requirements for an adequate national pension
and provident fund system; (ii) crafting recommendations for improving the legal, regulatory, and
tax frameworks; (iii) building a financial model to evaluate the fiscal health of EPFO and creating
a strategy to modernize the institution; and (iv) developing a proposal for the establishment of a
pension research institute.

D.        Evaluation

8.       The TA was self-evaluated by the operational department and rated as successful. An
Operations Evaluation Mission (OEM) visited India in August 2003. The OEM held discussions
with a large number of institutions, market participants, the TA executing agency, regulatory
authorities, and other stakeholders. This evaluation is based on (i) a review of the rationale,
purpose, and expected outcomes of each TA; and (ii) an analysis of actual outcomes and
impacts as revealed in discussions by the OEM. The OEM reviewed relevant ADB records,
analyzed pertinent data collected in the field, and supplemented this information with follow-up
discussions with ADB staff and additional research when needed. The OEM evaluated the TA in
terms of (i) the relevance of its design in relation to its underlying rationale and objectives, as
well as its consistency with the Government's priorities for the sector and with ADB's sector
strategy; (ii) the achievement of its design objectives; (iii) the efficiency of its implementation;
(iv) the sustainability of its contributions; and (v) the magnitude and significance of its impacts.

II.    Assessment of Design and Scope

A.     Design

9.      The TA was designed to satisfy the Government's request for support in developing
sources of long-term capital for investment. In this sense, the design of the TA met the
Government's broad objectives. However, the design provided for a number of tasks--including
an analysis of both formal and informal mechanisms for providing retirement income support to
the elderly, recommendations for strengthening the legal, regulatory, and tax frameworks, and
the design of a pension research institute--that had little government support and no obvious
counterparts. India was not institutionally ready (or interested) in these components of the TA
and, as a result, the consultants were unable to effectively engage the Government on these
issues.

10.    The decision to place the TA under the jurisdiction of EPFO effectively isolated the team
from addressing broader issues of pension policy. In combination with a management change at
EPFO, however--which created a strong demand for the TA's services--this decision did
improve the TA's effectiveness in addressing tasks related to the strengthening of EPFO.

11.     The TA supported two activities that were not part of its original design. These included
(i) sponsoring a trip for the commissioner of EPFO to visit the Social Security Administration in
Washington, DC in conjunction with a pension seminar he was attending in Boston,
Massachusetts; and (ii) sponsoring a trip for a senior EPFO official to the US in order to attend a
workshop on "Finding the Path to a Sustainable Pension System." Both deviations from the TA's
design were justified on the basis of the need to develop greater understanding and
appreciation for pension policy issues on the part of the TA's counterparts.

B.     Engagement of Consultants

12.     The TA was implemented through a private consulting firm. The firm and its consultants
were selected in accordance with the procedures established by ADB's Guidelines on the Use
of Consultants. The number of international consultants actually used (five) and their actual
level of effort (19.0 person-months) differed slightly from what was planned (four consultants
and 19.0 person-months). The number of domestic consultants actually used (five) and their
actual level of effort (22.0 person-months) matched exactly what was planned. International
consultants planned included (i) a pension and provident funds expert and economist/team
leader (6 person-months), (ii) a pension and provident fund specialist (5 person-months), (iii) a
pension and provident fund operations specialist (4 person-months), and (iv) an actuary
(4 person-months).

C.     Implementation and Cost

13.    The Ministry of Labor served as the executing agency for the TA. EPFO served as its
implementing agency. EPFO provided excellent support to the TA in terms of offices,
counterpart staff, transportation, and other services.

14.     The TA closed 12 months later than was originally planned. This was due, in part, to
start-up delays on the part of the Government that were resolved only when EPFO took over the
implementation of the TA. Until then, the TA had been languishing without government
ownership or support. It was also due to (i) difficulties in scheduling workshops with
representatives of EPFO's management and Central Board of Trustees, the Ministry of Labor
56     Appendix 8


and other central and state government agencies, and other stakeholders to discuss the TA's
draft final report; and (ii) the resulting need for an extension to give the Government time to
provide comments on the draft final report and ensure that major issues were addressed.

15.      The assumption of responsibility for TA implementation by EPFO prevented the TA from
languishing further, but it was not without cost. Being based in EPFO constrained the team's
ability to satisfy those tasks in its terms of reference (TOR) outside EPFO's sphere of interest.
Some of the consultants were unable to complete their anticipated level of effort because EPFO
did not need and want their expertise. The consultants held very few discussions with
government officials, and, not surprisingly, their recommendations were not embraced or
adopted. The TA did not, therefore, fully satisfy its mandate to provide a viable policy framework
for private pension reform. A process for the development of such a framework was designed in
consultation with some of the relevant stakeholders and efforts were made to commence
discussions on this issue. The complexity of the issues, logistical difficulties in assembling the
stakeholders, and varying levels of interest on the part of various government agencies proved
a formidable obstacle to consensus building.

16.     Nevertheless, the work accomplished on behalf of EPFO was appreciated, well received,
and continues to guide and support EPFO's activities. In retrospect, ADB could have been more
responsive in how it managed the TA, without straying too far from the TA's mandate, by
redirecting resources earlier in order to support the activities of an agency that needed those
resources. As a result, some of the consultants were not effectively utilized, and a mismatch
emerged between the TA's mission, as outlined in its TOR, and the needs of its counterparts on
the ground.

17.    Given the implementation difficulties described above, 12% of the TA's funds were not
disbursed.

III.   Achievement of Purpose and Outcomes

A.     Performance of Consultants and Quality of Reports

18.     Given the mismatch between the TOR and the challenges actually faced by the TA's
consultants, the consultants performed reasonably well. They were responsive to the needs of
EPFO and adapted their work planning accordingly. Their responsiveness and their ability to
effectively support EPFO was due in large measure to the performance of the team leader. A
former commissioner of the US Social Security Administration, the team leader brought a
uniquely appropriate combination of operational and managerial skills and experience to his
work--skills and experience which were instrumental in helping EPFO plan for and implement
financial and operational restructuring. The overall quality of the TA's reports was inconsistent,
as is discussed further below.

B.     TA Outputs

19.     The primary outputs of the TA included (i) inception, interim, and final reports; (ii) a
regional seminar organized with the ADB Institute named "Capacity Building Conference on
Reforming Pension Systems in South Asia" and held in December 2000; and (iii) workshops
conducted in February 2001 involving stakeholders. Recommendations for the organizational
and operational restructuring of EPFO--contained in the third volume of the consultants' final
report--were comprehensive, practical, based on solid analysis, and backed by direct
experience. The remaining volumes of their final report were less satisfactory. The first volume
                                                                                                Appendix 8      57


(which addresses the framework for pension reform) and the fourth volume (which includes
attachments) were elementary and not specific enough to India. Neither the road map outlining
the establishment of a framework for pension reform nor the section of the report addressing
international accounting standards fully satisfied the TOR.

C.        TA Outcomes

20.     Virtually all of the impact of this TA occurred at the provident fund. EPFO management
accepted and embraced many of the TA's recommendations. Implementation of these
recommendations is under way, including financial and operational restructuring. EPFO has
contracted with a major software firm to support its operational changes by designing systems
software and pilot testing operational changes using the new software at six branch offices.
Simultaneously, training of EPFO staff is in progress. To enable staff to operate the system,
3,000 employees were trained in the use of computers and an additional 5,000 were expected
to have undergone training by the end of the TA. Executive workshops have been held for
450 managers in preparation for the restructuring, and their aptitudes for change have been
tested. While operational restructuring of EPFO is a task of considerable magnitude and will
take time, the clear vision and specific step-by-step processes recommended under the TA
greatly enhanced the chances of its success.

21.     The impact of the other components of the TA--including (i) the preparation of a study of
both formal and informal mechanisms of retirement income support; (ii) the identification of long-
term requirements for an adequate national pension and provident fund system; (iii) the crafting
of recommendations for improving the legal, regulatory, and tax frameworks; and (iv) the
creation of a proposal for the establishment of a pension research institute--were very weak
and not taken up by the Government. The department responsible for the capital markets within
the Ministry of Finance--which has been tasked recently with overall responsibility for pension
reform--was not even aware of the TA's final report, much less familiar with what it contained.5
The TA's proposal for a pension research institute was included in the final report but has not
received much consideration.

IV.       Overall Assessment

22.      Assessing this TA is problematic, given the juxtaposition between the clearly valuable
and successful support provided to EPFO and the absence of meaningful impacts from those
components of the TOR unrelated to EPFO. Overall, the TA was relevant, but it was clearly
implemented too early for India. Had the TA been implemented even a year later, its impact
would likely have been more substantial. It was less efficacious by virtue of the fact that it only
satisfied a portion of its TOR. Those outcomes related to EPFO are highly sustainable. The
remaining outcomes, however, are unlikely to be sustained. Given delays and the inconsistent
achievement of desired outcomes, the TA was less efficient than was anticipated. The capacity
building provided by the TA to EPFO was substantial, as were the TA's contributions to its
institutional development. Given the success of the TA with regard to EPFO, the overall rating of
this TA is partly successful.




5
    Staff from the Ministry of Finance had had conversations with one of the TA's consultants on pension issues but
    was unaware of the fact that the TA's TOR extended well beyond EPFO. The OEM provided a copy of the TA's
    final report to this office during the mission.

V.        Conclusions

A.        Key Issues

23.      There was no effective executing or implementing agency for more than half of the
components of this TA. The identification of appropriate agencies--with institutional jurisdiction
and authority covering all of the components of this TA--should have been a condition for its
approval. ADB could have been more responsive in how it managed the TA, without straying too
far from the TA's mandate, by redirecting resources earlier in order to support the activities of an
agency that needed those resources. Moreover, TA must be directed toward those issues which
the Government has expressed a strong commitment to resolving. The design of this TA
provided for a number of tasks--including an analysis of both formal and informal mechanisms
for providing retirement income support to the elderly; recommendations for strengthening the
legal, regulatory, and tax frameworks; and the design of a pension research institute--that had
little governmental support and no obvious counterparts. India was not institutionally ready (or
interested) in these components of the TA and, as a result, the consultants were unable to
effectively engage the Government on these issues.

B.        Lessons Learned

24.     The design of TA must respect the specific needs, constraints, state of economic
development, human, and financial capacity of the country it is intended to support. Overly
ambitious designs for countries with low levels of institutional development are bound to fall
short of expectations.

25.     A careful assessment of institutional constraints, agendas, and capacity is required as
part of TA design in order to avoid undertaking tasks prematurely, wasting resources on tasks
for which there is no political appetite, and design flaws that hinder the ability of consultants to
satisfy their TORs.

26.   Flexibility in TA management on the part of ADB is needed to enable its consultants to
respond to changing situations and to redirect resources as needed to enhance a TA's impact.

C.        Follow-Up Actions and Recommendations

27.    Reforming the public pension schemes and the provident funds is becoming a priority as
the Government comes to terms with the need to reduce the unfunded pension liability of these
schemes in order to reduce its overall debt to sustainable levels. For new government
employees, a higher (10%) contribution rate is now being levied against their wages to finance
the cost of their pension benefits. This is a good first step, and the Government should be
supported with such efforts. A follow-on TA6 is being prepared to provide further support for
pension reforms activities. Given still limited institutional capacity, this follow-on TA represents
an appropriate commitment of support at this time.




6
    The capital market division of the Ministry of Finance is now responsible for pension issues. ADB is providing
    additional TA intended to pursue some of the activities--primarily related to voluntary private pension schemes --
    that were not accomplished under this TA. The Government now appears more institutionally prepared for this
    assistance than it was when this TA was being designed and implemented.
